       "{'paper_0.html': ['Two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors have garnered significant interest in the scientific community due to their unique electronic, optical, and physical properties. Among them, 2D TMDs are particularly promising candidates. They possess a direct bandgap in their MLs and exhibit strong light-matter interactions due to quantum confinement effects, resulting in high absorption and unusual spin-orbit coupling effects1,2. The binding energy of excitons in ML TMDs is considerably higher due to increased Coulomb interactions3,4and reduced dielectric screening5. Consequently, quasi-particles such as excitons3,6, trion7,8, and biexcitons9can exist in ML TMDs even at room temperature.',\n",
       "  'The high binding energy and enhanced stability of excitons make 2D TMDs excellent materials for lighting applications10,11,12. Additionally, TMDs are suitable for other atomically thin optoelectronic devices, including transistors13, phototransistors14, energy conversion15,16, and storage devices17. Large-area ML TMDs are indispensable for realizing ultralight optoelectronic devices for practical and industrial applications18,19,20. However, the growth of large-area ML TMDs by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) requires high growth temperatures, suitable substrates, and precursors, which limits their potential applications21,22. To overcome these limitations, a viable method for device fabrication involving TMDs is the transfer of as-grown samples onto desired substrates. This layer transfer is also crucial for removing growth precursors to avoid unwanted doping23, and fabrication of flexible24and heterostructure devices25,26. In principle, the scattering by impurities and defects at the TMD/substrate interface can affect carrier mobility, thereby altering the performance of TMD-based optoelectronic devices27,28. Previous reports suggest that transfer process can induce strain and charge doping, ultimately impacting the carrier mobility and electronic band structure of 2D TMDs29,30. The electronic structure of 2D TMDs changes due to induced strain during transfer process31. The bandgap of layered TMDs is reported to be reduced under non-uniform strain32,33.',\n",
       "  'Understanding the dynamics of charge carriers in layered TMDs is fundamental for the realization of TMD-based electronic and optoelectronic devices. For light-emitting devices, non-radiative carrier recombination channels, such as defect capturing and Auger recombination, are critical factors that diminish charge carrier lifetime and limit the emission quantum yield or brightness of optoelectronic devices34,35,36. In recent years, researchers have sought to increase the emission quantum yield of 2D TMDs using various electronic and chemical approaches31,37,38. These efforts have enhanced emission efficiency at lower excitation densities, but at higher densities, exciton-exciton annihilation (EEA) limits the emission yield. In this context, the effect of substrates on exciton dynamics in TMDs remains largely unexplored. Understanding how substrates influence EEA and subsequently impact excitonic lifetime is imperative for advancing high-performance optoelectronic devices based on 2D TMDs.',\n",
       "  'In this work, we employed femtosecond transient absorption (TA) spectroscopy to probe the substrate-induced effects on the dynamical behavior of excitons in ML MoS2supported on sapphire, quartz, and Si/SiO2. Steady-state spectroscopic measurements reveal that the optical properties of as-grown MoS2are markedly different from transferred samples due to the creation of new defects during the transfer process. Density functional theory (DFT) was used to unveil the effect of induced strain on the optical properties of MoS2. Our TA studies demonstrate that exciton dynamics in 2D MoS2depend not only on the substrate but also on the sample preparation process (as-grown or transferred). The EEA rate decreases significantly when MoS2grown on sapphire is transferred to a Si/SiO2substrate. Moreover, the EEA rate is temperature-dependent and reduces at low temperatures. We discuss plausible explanations for the variation of EEA rate with substrate and temperature, emphasizing the role of defect capturing and thermally assisted exciton-exciton interaction. This detailed study illuminates the complex interplay between substrate-induced defects and strain on exciton dynamics in 2D TMDs during transfer processes, offering critical insights for the advancement of optoelectronic devices.',\n",
       "  'Large-area ML MoS2was grown on double-side polished (DSP) sapphire and subsequently transferred onto various substrates, including DSP quartz, DSP sapphire, and Si/SiO2. Continuous ML MoS2films on these substrates are evident from the optical images depicted in FigureS1(a-d). The absorption (red curve) and photoluminescence (PL) (blue curve) spectra for all MoS2samples were measured at room temperature, as shown in Fig.1a–d. Figure1a indicates that the as-grown MoS2exhibits two distinct absorption peaks at 1.91\\xa0eV and 2.04\\xa0eV, corresponding to the A and B excitons, which arise from the optical transitions between the spin-split valence band (VB) and the conduction band (CB)1,39,40. The band nesting effect in ML MoS2leads to a C-exciton transition (according to Wilson and Yoffe’s nomenclature), which becomes prominent at higher energies, around 2.87 eV6,41.',\n",

       "  'The absorption spectra of the transferred samples are presented in Fig.1b–d. In these samples, the A-exciton peak is observed to shift towards lower energy, with the shift following the order: DSP quartz (1.90\\xa0eV) to DSP sapphire (1.89\\xa0eV) to Si/SiO2(1.89\\xa0eV). The PL spectrum of as-grown ML MoS2shows emission peaks corresponding to the A (~\\u20091.86\\xa0eV) and B (~\\u20091.97\\xa0eV) excitons, as depicted in Fig.1a. A broadening of the emission spectra (recorded under identical excitation energy) and the emergence of a shoulder peak (~\\u20091.75\\xa0eV) are observed in the transferred MoS2on sapphire and quartz substrates (Fig.1b,c). This additional shoulder peak in the PL spectra of transferred MoS2could be attributed to either emission from defect states or trion emission, which will be discussed further. In contrast, the PL spectrum (recorded under identical excitation energy) of MoS2transferred onto Si/SiO2is similar to that of the as-grown sample.',\n",
       "  'The ML nature of our samples was confirmed using Raman spectroscopy and verified for homogeneity by optical microscopy (FigureS1). Thickness measurements, performed using atomic force microscopy (AFM), indicated that the thicknesses of the transferred samples are slightly greater than those of the as-grown MoS2(Figure S2). This increase in thickness is likely due to the formation of air bubbles between the layer and the substrate during the transfer process. The Raman spectrum of as-grown MoS2exhibits peaks at approximately 385.6\\xa0cm⁻¹ and 405\\xa0cm⁻¹, corresponding to the in-plane (\\\\(E_{{2g}}^{1}\\\\)) and out-of-plane (\\\\(\\\\:{A}_{1g}\\\\)) vibrations, respectively (Fig.2a). The separation between these two peaks is about 19.4\\xa0cm⁻¹, confirming the monolayer nature of the MoS2film42,43,44,45. A small Raman peak observed at 419\\xa0cm⁻¹ in both the as-grown and transferred samples on sapphire (Fig.2a) is attributed to the Raman signature of the sapphire substrate46,47. In the transferred MoS2samples, the Raman peak corresponding to the E12\\xa0gmode shows a slight blueshift compared to the as-grown sample. This shift is attributed to strain release or defects in the transferred samples. The strain release in ML MoS2likely arises from variations in the thermal expansion coefficient during the transfer process48,49,50. It has been reported that strain primarily affects the in-plane vibration (E12\\xa0g) of MoS2, while the out-of-plane vibration (A1g) remains unaffected51,52, which is consistent with our observations.',\n",
       "  '(a) Raman spectra of ML MoS2on four different substrates. (b) Deconvolution of the PL spectra of as-grown and transferred ML MoS2into four curves (combination of Gaussian and Lorentzian). A, B, T, and D represent contributions of A-exciton, B-exciton, trion, and defect emission, respectively to the total PL.',\n",
       "  'To investigate the impact of the change of substrate on PL properties of ML MoS2, the emission spectra (recorded at room temperature under identical excitation energy) were fitted using a combination of Gaussian and Lorentzian (Voigt) functions. Theoretically, the linewidth broadening of excitonic PL in ML TMDs follows a Lorentzian shape. However, inhomogeneities introduced by ripples or bubbles require the inclusion of a Gaussian component to accurately model the spectra53. We found that a minimum of four components was necessary to adequately fit the PL spectra for all samples (Fig.2b). The PL spectrum of as-grown MoS2displays distinct A and B-exciton peaks centered around ~\\u20091.86\\xa0eV and ~\\u20091.97\\xa0eV, respectively1. An additional peak at 1.81\\xa0eV is attributed to charged exciton or trion emission, as reported in previous studies8,54. Figure2b shows that both A-exciton and trion emission peaks are red-shifted in the transferred MoS2samples. These red-shifts cannot be attributed to the release of strain when the MoS2layer was transferred to different substrates, as strain release typically results in a blue-shift in PL spectrum55. Instead, the observed red-shifts suggest the introduction of a different type of strain. While strain release generally causes a blue-shift in the PL spectrum, the prominent red-shift observed here indicates that other factors are at play. AFM mapping of the transferred samples (Figure S3) reveals the presence of bubbles or ripples, which are likely responsible for the non-uniform strain. Therefore, the observed red-shift in the PL spectra is attributed to the non-uniform strain induced by these bubbles or ripples formed during the transfer process. Harats et al. reported a similar red-shift in the PL spectrum and trion formation due to non-uniform strain in WS2, as predicted by the drift-diffusion model56. Various studies have investigated the impact of strain on the PL properties of ML MoS2, indicating that the optical bandgap is modified by strain33,57,58. Additionally, the lowest energy peak in the PL spectra (labelled as “D”) is attributed to emission from defect-bound excitons59,60. The relative contributions of A-exciton, B-exciton, trion, and defect emissions were determined from the fitting of PL spectra (TableS1). We found that the percentage of defect emission is higher in samples transferred onto sapphire (18%) and quartz (33%) substrates compared to Si/SiO2(13%) and the as-grown MoS2(12%). These results indicate a significant increase in defect states in MoS2transferred to sapphire and quartz substrates, in contrast to the sample transferred onto Si/SiO2.',\n",
       "  'As previously discussed, the A-exciton absorption peak of ML MoS2shifts with transfer of the substrate. This shift is attributed to strain induced by the formation of ripples or bubbles and lattice parameters mismatch between the ML and the substrate61,62. To elucidate the effect of strain on the optical properties of MoS2, we calculated the band structure of ML MoS2using density functional theory (DFT) under various tensile strains. Our calculations show that the bandgap of pristine MoS2decreases with increasing tensile strain (Figure S4), aligning with prior theoretical reports45,63,64,65. Additionally, to investigate the effects of specific substrates, we modelled MoS2placed on quartz and sapphire substrates (Fig.3a,b). The lattice mismatches and associated strains are relatively small (1.2% for MoS2/quartz and 3.5% for MoS2/sapphire) while maintaining a hexagonal unit cell. The calculated bandgaps for MoS2on quartz and sapphire are 2.02\\xa0eV and 1.10\\xa0eV, respectively (Fig.3c,d). The change in the calculated bandgap is significantly larger than the experimentally observed value. Several factors could contribute to this discrepancy. First, the experiments were conducted at room temperature (300\\xa0K), whereas the calculations were performed at 0\\xa0K. Second, only strain due to lattice mismatch was considered in the calculations, while other factors, such as ripples or bubbles present in actual samples, were not accounted for. However, DFT calculations exhibit the same trend of decreasing bandgap from quartz to sapphire as observed in the experiment (Fig.1b,c), suggesting that strain can alter the bandgap of ML MoS2.',\n",

       "  'The variation in the intensity of defect-related PL across different samples (Fig.2b) suggests the presence of varying levels and types of defects in the ML MoS2samples. To quantitatively assess the presence of defects, we conducted X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements. High-resolution XPS spectra of Mo 3d for all samples are shown in Fig.4a–d. The Mo 3d spectrum exhibits two prominent emission peaks at 232\\xa0eV (Mo 3d3/2) and 229.6\\xa0eV (Mo 3d5/2), corresponding to the Mo4+state in MoS266,67. Moreover, a peak at 226.6\\xa0eV is attributed to the S 2s state, as reported previously68,69. Another small peak appears in all four samples around 236\\xa0eV with different intensities. This peak corresponds to the Mo6+state, indicative of molybdenum oxides (MoO3) formation67. The XPS spectra were fitted using a Voigt profile on a Shirley-type background to determine the contribution of each peak. The area under the oxide (Mo-O) peaks serves as a measure of oxidation-related defects in the samples. The percentage contributions (i.e., area integral percentages) of the Mo-O (Mo6+) peaks, calculated from Fig.4, are 13.9, 9.8, 10.2, and 20.2% for the as-grown and transferred MoS2on sapphire, quartz, and Si/SiO2, respectively. These results indicate that the density of oxygen-related defects is comparatively lower in the transferred samples on sapphire and quartz compared to the as-grown and transferred samples on Si/SiO2.',\n",
       "  'The as-grown MoS2samples on sapphire contain oxygen-related defects primarily due to the residual oxygen present during the CVD process or the deposition of unreacted MoO3on the sapphire surface70,71. However, during the transfer process, MoS2is moved from its original growth substrate to a new substrate (sapphire or quartz). The transfer process involves steps such as cleaning and annealing72, which can reduce or eliminate these residuals and oxygen-related defects. As a result, the transferred MoS2samples on sapphire and quartz exhibit lower oxygen defect densities compared to the as-grown samples on sapphire.',\n",
       "  'Furthermore, we calculated the stoichiometric ratios of Mo to S from the XPS data (a detailed analysis is provided in the Supporting Information). We have found that the ratio of Mo: S is 1:1.9 in as-grown MoS2on sapphire, and 1:1.75, 1:1.7 and 1:1.88 in transferred MoS2on sapphire, quartz, and Si/SiO2, respectively. Consequently, the estimated sulfur deficiency is 5%, 12.5%, 15%, and 6% for the as-grown MoS2on sapphire and for MoS2transferred onto sapphire, quartz, and Si/SiO2, respectively. The XPS analysis indicates a notable increase in sulfur vacancies in the samples transferred onto sapphire and quartz. This observation correlates with the variation in defect-related PL intensity, where the defect-PL follows the trend: as-grown\\u2009<\\u2009Si/SiO2<\\u2009sapphire\\u2009<\\u2009quartz. This trend is consistent with the increase in sulfur vacancies, suggesting that sulfur vacancies are the predominant defect type in transferred ML MoS2on sapphire and quartz.',\n",

       "  'To investigate the influence of substrate material on exciton dynamics in ML MoS2, we performed TA measurements on our samples. The TA spectra for as-grown ML MoS2on sapphire and transferred MoS2on various substrates, measured at both room temperature and at 77\\xa0K, are presented in Fig.5a,b. The TA spectra exhibit two prominent features: ground state bleach (GSB) corresponding to A and B excitonic transitions and positive photoinduced absorption (PIA) observed on the low-energy side of the TA spectra (not present in MoS2/Si/SiO2). The appearance of GSB at exciton resonance is attributed to Pauli blocking73,74. Whereas, PIA is associated with phenomena such as carrier-induced broadening, biexciton formation, or free carrier absorption75,76,77. The broadening of GSB bands in the TA spectra of transferred samples is notably more pronounced compared to that of the as-grown ML MoS2(Fig.5a). This broadening can be attributed to an increased density of defect states in the transferred samples. We compared the decay kinetics of the A-exciton bleach across all samples (Fig.5c) and observed that samples transferred onto sapphire and quartz display a positive ΔA signal following the initial negative bleach signal. Such a sign-changing behavior in the A-exciton bleach signal is commonly associated with mid-gap defect states in TMDs78. Therefore, the comparison of bleach kinetics suggests a higher density of mid-gap defect states in samples transferred onto sapphire and quartz compared to the other samples. These mid-gap defects are likely correlated with the higher density of sulfur vacancies, as indicated by the XPS analysis and supported by previous literature79,80,81.',\n",
       "  'The bleach signals corresponding to the A and B excitonic transitions of as-grown MoS2exhibit a blue-shift at low temperature (Fig.5b). This blue-shift is likely due to the suppression of electron-phonon interactions and lattice contraction, which results in an increased optical bandgap at lower temperatures82,83,84,85,86. Additionally, a shoulder feature around 1.86\\xa0eV appears in the A-exciton bleach of as-grown ML MoS2at low temperature (Fig.5b). This shoulder could be attributed to charged excitons or defect-bound excitons59,87. However, trions (charged excitons) are typically formed after excitons, and thus, are unlikely to contribute to the bleach shoulder. Therefore, this shoulder peak is likely associated with excitons trapped by defect states within the ML MoS2. In contrast, transferred samples on sapphire and quartz exhibit a splitting of the bleach band (Fig.5b). The low-energy bleach component is attributed to excitons trapped in defect states, which have energy levels.',\n",

The observed splitting and appearance of separate bleach bands for trapped excitons at low temperature can be explained by the blue-shift of the A-exciton bleach due to the increase in bandgap and the reduced linewidth broadening of free and bound exciton transitions.',\n",
       "  'We compared the kinetics of the low-energy bleach band for all samples at low temperature (Fig.5d). The negative ΔA followed by a high positive signal indicates a high density of defects in samples transferred onto sapphire and quartz. The TA kinetics at the split bands (1.83 and 1.89\\xa0eV) for MoS2on sapphire and quartz exhibit notable differences at 77\\xa0K (Figure S6). While ΔA remains negative for the high-energy bleach bands, it transitions to positive values for the low-energy bands. The prominent splitting of the A-exciton bleach band at low temperature and the sign-changing behavior of ΔA suggest that the transient optical response of MoS2transferred onto sapphire and quartz is predominantly influenced by mid-gap defects, likely originating from sulfur vacancies.',\n",
       "  'Both steady-state and TA studies indicate that transferring ML MoS2onto different substrates introduces additional defects and strain into the MoS2layer.

The fast decay component, occurring on the sub-picosecond timescale, could be attributed to processes such as hot carrier cooling, carrier-phonon scattering, or carrier trapping by defect states74,88. Since the excitation energy was only slightly above the band edge, the generation of hot carriers is negligible. Additionally, the time constant T1increases with excitation fluence and reaches a constant value, indicative of a defect-capturing process89,90. Therefore, T1is likely associated with the time required for excitons to be captured by defect states. The intermediate decay component (T2) with a lifetime of ~\\u20097–13 ps, is characteristic of second-order relaxation processes such as Auger recombination, exciton-exciton annihilation (EEA)89,91,92, and trion recombination93. The observed decrease in T2with increasing excitation fluence, accompanied by an increase in amplitude, suggests that this component is related to EEA. The slow component, with a time constant in the hundreds of picoseconds, is likely associated with radiative excitonic decay, as reported in the literature44,92,94.',\n",
       "  'The decay kinetics of A-excitons in ML MoS2transferred onto sapphire and quartz exhibit distinct behaviors, as illustrated in Fig.6b,c. In both cases, ΔA transitions from a negative to a positive value at high photon fluence. The initial part of the decay was fitted, revealing that a fast decay occurring on the sub-picosecond timescale (~\\u20090.07–0.1 ps) dominates the early decay (Table S3). According to previous studies, this behavior in TA kinetics could be attributed to PIA by trapped carriers in mid-gap defects, which can overshadow the bleach signal due to Pauli blocking78,95. Consequently, the positive shift in ΔA indicates a higher density of mid-gap defects in MoS2transferred onto sapphire and quartz compared to the as-grown sample. Conversely, the TA kinetics of MoS2transferred onto Si/SiO2(Fig.6d) are similar to those of the as-grown MoS2, showing no positive signal. This suggests that MoS2transferred onto Si/SiO2, like the as-grown sample, has a lower density of sulfur defects. Recent studies suggest that the Si/SiO2substrate may passivate sulfur defects through adsorption O2at vacancy sites79,96. However, shallow traps due to oxygen vacancies still contribute to carrier decay in all samples. Therefore, the recombination dynamics of excitons and carriers in ML MoS2are influenced by both the substrate material and the preparation method (as-grown or transferred), due to the formation of varying concentrations of mid-gap and shallow defects. A schematic representation of the carrier dynamics, based on TA measurements, is illustrated in Fig.7a alongside the band structure of ML MoS2.',\n",

The fitting results for the growth kinetics at 1.77\\xa0eV are presented in Figure S7. The data indicate that the rise of the PIA signal at 1.77\\xa0eV is comparable to the initial sub-picosecond decay of the A-exciton bleach at the same fluence (Tables S2, S3, and S4). This observation further suggests that the PIA at 1.77\\xa0eV is associated with absorption by defect carriers. The rise time of the PIA signal reflects the carrier capture time by defect states. Comparison of the exciton capture times (Table1) reveals that carrier capture is faster in MoS2transferred onto quartz and sapphire than in MoS2transferred onto Si/SiO2and as-grown samples. The higher density of mid-gap states in MoS2transferred onto quartz and sapphire likely accelerates the carrier capture rate in these samples.',\n",
       "  'It is well known that in strongly confined systems such as quantum dots and 2D materials, strong optical excitation can result in the annihilation of excitons97,98. Due to enhanced Coulomb interactions, MoS2ML exhibits bound excitons, and strong exciton-exciton coupling results in EEA (at high excitation densities), which is a bimolecular process involving two or more excitons. Other second-order processes, such as biexciton formation, are negligible at the temperature investigated here (Fig.6a,d)99,100. Additionally, the significant inhomogeneous broadening of the samples made it difficult to clearly differentiate between exciton and biexciton differential absorption. In the presence of EEA, the rate equation for a bimolecular recombination is described by98,101',\n",

The solution of this equation can, in principle, be utilized to analyze TA kinetics; however, for pedagogical clarity, we considered the two components separately. The first term of Eq.\\xa0(2) represents first-order excitonic recombination, which dominates only at longer timescales. Conversely, EEA, being faster than monomolecular excitonic recombination, predominates at early times when the exciton density is high. Therefore, the annihilation rate can be determined by solving Eq.\\xa0(2) considering only the second term. The solution to this rate equation is presented below.',\n",

The values of EEA rates obtained from the fitting are presented in Table2. A notable disparity in the EEA rates between the transferred ML MoS2and its as-grown counterpart was uncovered. Our findings suggest that the average EEA rate in transferred MoS2(\\\\(\\\\:0.106\\\\pm\\\\:0.005\\\\:c{m}^{2}/sec\\\\)) is lower than the as-grown ML (\\\\(\\\\:0.204\\\\pm\\\\:0.002\\\\:c{m}^{2}/sec\\\\)). This discrepancy further supports the notion that substrate-induced defects and strain significantly affect EEA. The introduction of defects during the transfer process serves as nonradiative recombination sites for excitons, competing with the annihilation process. Consequently, these defect states can alter the spatial distribution and mutual interaction of excitons, thereby influencing their probability of annihilation. The lower EEA rate in ML MoS2transferred on Si/SiO2could be a consequence of its higher density of oxygen defects (as evident from XPS measurements) compared to as-grown MoS2. Moreover, induced strain during transfer process can modify the electronic band structure, affecting the exciton binding energy and subsequently influencing the formation, diffusion, and interaction of excitons. Thus, both strain and defects could play a pivotal role in determining the fluence range over which excitons do not undergo annihilation.',\n",

Thus, the EEA rate is greatly reduced at low temperature. At low temperature, the thermal energy available to excitons decreases, leading to slower diffusion and a lower probability of exciton encounter, which in turn reduces the rate of annihilation. Additionally, the phonon population diminishes at low temperature, leading to a decrease in phonon-assisted exciton relaxation pathways. This reduction in phonon-mediated recombination processes could suppress EEA. It is noteworthy that the determination of the annihilation rate constant in the other two samples transferred on sapphire and quartz is not feasible because PIA signals due to trapped carriers supersede the bleach signal in the time window where EEA takes place (Fig.6b,c).',\n",
       "  'It is evident from the above discussion that the interplay between defects and Auger-type recombination (EEA) plays a significant role in shaping the carrier dynamics in 2D materials like MoS2. Recent studies have further highlighted the intricate relationships underlying these processes. For example, Wang et al.102highlighted the critical role of defect states in carrier trapping and their subsequent impact on recombination dynamics. Based on the dependence of the measured data on the pump fluence and temperature, they pointed out that other mechanisms of nonradiative recombination and carrier capture by defects are insignificant. Strong Coulomb interactions in 2D materials make Auger scattering more effective. Similarly, Shin et al.103provided in-depth analysis of how defect-induced trapping competes with Auger recombination, emphasizing the necessity of understanding these interactions for optimizing material performance.',\n",

The ability to control sulfur vacancies in MoS2by transferring it onto different substrates opens up promising avenues for future device applications107. These defects can enhance the electrical conductivity and carrier density of MoS2, making it a promising material for use in electronic and optoelectronic devices108. For instance, sulfur vacancies have been shown to improve the performance of MoS2-based transistors and sensors by increasing their sensitivity and response time107,109. Sulfur vacancies in MoS2introduce localized states within the bandgap, which can act as active sites for adsorption, enhancing the sensitivity and response time of sensors110. In the context of transistors, while defects are generally viewed as detrimental, controlled introduction of sulfur vacancies can lower the contact resistance and improve the charge carrier injection efficiency, this can lead to enhanced overall performance of the transistors111. Yin et al.112have shown that due to the strong trap effect, device based on TMDs can function as an infrared detector with high photoresponsivity and a high photo-switching ratio. It can also act as non-volatile optoelectronic memory with a high program/erase ratio and fast switching times. Additionally, the enhanced emission properties due to sulfur defects can be leveraged in developing more efficient LEDs and photodetectors113. Moreover, the ability to control sulfur vacancies offers pathways to tailor the electrical properties of MoS2, making it an excellent candidate for next-generation transistors and flexible electronics107,108. The substrate-induced variations in sulfur vacancy densities can be strategically employed to design MoS2-based devices with optimized performance and functionality114,115. The reduced EEA rate can improve the exciton lifetime, leading to higher device efficiency and stability116,117.

Our comprehensive study, encompassing measurements of absorption, emission, and DFT calculations, reveals that substrate or air bubble-induced strains can modify the optical properties of MoS2by altering its band structure. XPS analysis unveils the presence of both sulfur and oxygen-induced defects in our samples, with defect PL increasing in MoS2transferred onto sapphire and quartz substrates due to an increased density of sulfur vacancies. Results from our femtosecond pump-probe spectroscopy measurements indicate that both oxygen and sulfur vacancies govern the charge carrier dynamics. The carrier capture time depends on the substrate, primarily due to the variation in sulfur vacancies in as-grown and transferred MoS2. Excitons decay via EEA at high excitation fluences, and at room temperature, the EEA rate of MoS2grown on sapphire (0.250 cm2/sec) is much higher than that of MoS2transferred onto Si/SiO2(0.106 cm2/sec). This change in the EEA rate could be attributed to substrate-induced defects (oxygen vacancies). Moreover, the EEA rate is greatly decreased at low temperature (77\\xa0K) due to a reduction in phonon-assisted exciton recombination.

In the WAAM process, a wire is used as a feedstock to manufacture parts layer-by-layer from various metallic materials; the fabrication and post-processing times are reduced by 40–60% and 15–20%, respectively1. The cold metal transfer (CMT) method has been extensively used in the WAAM process to further improve the fabrication process. It requires a low heat input and high control of the process parameters and yields a smooth surface finish without spatter2,3. The molten pool in WAAM and arc welding is affected by different driving forces, with surface tension and electromagnetic forces being the most influential. In CMT-WAAM, the wire moves forward towards and backward from the melt pool within a few microseconds to transfer the metal with a low heat input. When the wire withdraws from the melt pool, a liquid bridge forms between the wire and the molten material before arc re-ignition4. The process parameters of CMT-WAAM, such as the arc voltage, slope of the power source, and circuit resistance, affect the liquid-metal bridge4,5. However, information regarding the interaction between the reciprocation motion of the wire and the molten materials that form the metal bridge, such as the involved force(s), is lacking. In a highly dynamic CMT-WAAM process with forward and backward wire movements within milliseconds, adjusting the bridge size and achieving optimal withdrawal and dipping cycles are challenging. Further research is required to reveal the dynamic behaviour of molten materials during CMT-WAAM. However, spatter and material ejection during CMT-WAAM have not yet been analytically investigated.',\n",
       "  'CMT is a modified feeding system used in gas-metal arc welding6. Researchers and engineers are continuously attempting to improve its features, and new techniques (e.g. pulse multi-control CMT with fast data processing and precise process control) have been established. Owing to its significant advantages over traditional techniques, CMT has been widely used in various industries, such as automotive, aerospace, and manufacturing3,7. The CMT method has been applied in welding and joining processes, particularly welding of coated thin sheets such as galvanised steels8. CMT is also used in surface-engineering processes, such as coating and cladding of different alloys, and offers substantial benefits over conventional welding counterparts9. In the CMT method, the wire exhibits a reciprocation motion in the direction of the melt pool. The forward and backward movements of the wire are generated by using a highly dynamic feeder10. During the forward movement of the wire, the burn arc is extinguished because of the interaction between the wire and molten pool and a reduction in the input power. The wire retracts or pulls back from the melt pool with an increase in the input power and causes arc re-ignition. The reciprocation motion of the wire, coupled with high-speed digital control, provides control over the weld geometry and energy input, along with smoother metal transfer during CMT. The current of the arc varies during the reciprocation motion of the wire and significantly reduces the heat input, which in turn results in a smaller heat-affected zone and lower dilution, distortion, and residual stress. The heat transfer and fluid flow during the CMT method have been 3D-modelled in several works. Cadiou et al.11estimated the forces in the melt pool during CMT, including the Lorentz forces, shear stress, arc pressure, and Joule effect for stainless steel; however, the CMT method was oversimplified. Although numerous studies on the CMT method have been conducted, the metal transfer mechanism of the ultra-high-dynamics wire-feeding system has not been rigorously explored. Furthermore, although CMT has been used in various industries for over two decades, the essential features of this method are yet to be elucidated.',\n",

Ceramic nanoparticles were employed to enhance material properties because they are very small and have a very high surface-to-volume ratio. We assumed that the pulling-up force during CMT varies with the adjustment of the chemical composition and that the properties of the additively manufactured or welded parts can be influenced. Different percentages of ceramic nanoparticles were used to validate this assumption, and the volume and weight of the materials along with the pulling-up force were quantitatively examined. Three images of CMT-WAAM with different percentages of TiC nanoparticles are presented in Fig.1b–d. With the addition of TiC, the volume of the lifted-up materials increases (Fig.1e), as also observed in the schematics (Fig.1b–d). Consequently, a higher pulling-up force is involved (Fig.1f), suggesting higher viscosity and surface tension. When the material adheres to the wire, the pulling-up force lifts the molten material above the surface and partially affects the melt pool.

Here, we describe the driving force in the CMT feeding system. We determined the effect of this force and estimated the quantitative values of the force along with the affected material volume. The pulling-up force plays a pivotal role during CMT in WAAM and welding because of the reciprocation motion of the wire in the melt pools. The long-standing issues and defects of WAAM (pores, cracks, surface roughness, etc.) and the re-melting of the deposited layer are influenced by the pulling-up force, and the molten materials are partially affected by the material properties. The pulling-up force impacts the dynamics of the melt flow, where a larger volume of the molten material is affected by a higher viscosity/surface tension and the involved force magnitude. In turn, higher dynamics in the molten material could result in a higher degree of defects; for instance, it could cause a turbulent molten pool, resulting in gas or air entrapment or higher surface roughness. The force involved and its impact on molten materials and the dynamics of the CMT should be examined and properly adjusted to optimise material transfer.

Here, we describe the dynamic behaviour of molten materials using the widely used CMT methods in the emerging WAAM process and welding.

Al has a relatively low viscosity at high temperatures (~1.3\\u2009mPa\\u2009s, determined using the Arrhenius equation) and shows viscosity (at 850\\u2009°C) comparable to that of water. The TiC nanoparticles significantly increase the viscosity, thereby suppressing thermocapillary flow and increasing the stickiness of the liquid Al. Therefore, the liquid bridge size increases significantly compared with that of pure AA5183. Prolonged withdrawal reduces the temperature of the molten material, thereby influencing the temperature field. In contrast, the burn-arc duration directly influences the temperature field of materials during WAAM or welding processes, where a protracted burn-arc duration increases the heat input. In the reciprocation motion of the wire at ~52 times per second during CMT, the withdrawal and dipping cycles should be explored and tuned to optimise the process.

As a result, they are widely used in a broad range of applications including automobiles, aircraft, helicopters, spacecraft, boats, and wind turbines (Monteforte2017). Driven by the increasing demand for lightweight structures and fuel efficiency, the aerospace and automotive industries are shifting towards greater use of plastics and composite parts (Monteforte2017; Pervaiz et al.2016). However, their use is limited by characteristics such as low electrical conductivity, low-thermal conductivity, susceptibility to erosion, and limited operating temperature ranges (Chen et al.2022).

With the growing interest in building more efficient aircraft, an increasing number of components are being designed from lightweight CFRP structures. However, CFRPs are poorer electrical and thermal conductors compared to aluminum alloys, which are the primary materials used in aircraft and aerospace construction (Karch and Metzner2016). The electrical resistance of carbon fibers is approximately 1000 times higher than that of aluminum, and the resistance of epoxy resins is about 1,000,000 times higher (Che et al.2017a; Liberati et al.2022a). Without additional design features, CFRP structures can suffer severe damage in the event of a lightning strike. Furthermore, electromagnetic fields can penetrate the aircraft through the less electrically conductive CFRP areas. Therefore, lightning protection and EMI shielding measures are necessary (Karch and Metzner2016). Moreover, possible applications in emerging sectors as electromobility or communication networks (e.g., 5G network components) could be advanced by cold spray metallization. With the rapid growth of electric vehicles, PMCs are increasingly utilized in lightweight electronic enclosures, wiring harness, battery casings, and EMI shielding for high-frequency sensors. Similarly, in the 5G era, PMCs are crucial for lightweight antennas and electronic housings where EMI mitigation is critical.',\n",
       "  'When lightning strikes an aircraft, it causes significant damage to the exterior skin, necessitating immediate maintenance. This leads to delays and temporary service outages. Lightning strikes can sometimes directly impact the aircraft and can also cause sparks that pose a fire hazard to materials inside the aircraft skin (Fig.1a) (Alemour et al.2019). The literature indicates that an aircraft can be struck by lightning on average once or twice a year (Black2013; Larsson et al.2005). Impacts from lightning strikes can result in delamination, perforation, or burning of composite materials. The electrical current flows through the carbon fibers, causing a temperature increase due to the Joule effect. This temperature rise leads to matrix deterioration and an increase in inter-ply pressure as the matrix evaporates, ultimately causing delaminations around the impact point (Bedel2018). Additionally, CFRPs are less thermally stable than metals, making them less resistant to extremely high temperatures. In areas like the front part of the engine, where most composite components are located, protection from extreme temperatures, such as during fire events, is crucial. An example of composite component damage in such a scenario is shown in Fig.1b (Mertz2021). Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop LSP solutions for composite outer skin of current and future aircraft generations (Che et al.2017a).',\n",

While the application of GHz-based electromagnetic waves offers significant convenience, it also poses problems such as electromagnetic pollution and EMI. These issues introduce various environmental hazards and causes threats to human health (Chen et al.2021). Electromagnetic radiation can lead to diseases such as brain tumors, cancer, leukemia, and immune system disorders in humans. EMI is caused by the propagation of periodically varying electromagnetic waves in space. An EMI wave directly emitted or transmitted by an electronic device can disrupt the electromagnetic receiver function of other devices. The interference created by consumer and defense electronics in space has raised the materials science community’s interest in addressing the increasing electromagnetic pollution. To mitigate the hazardous effects of EMI on human health and the performance of electronic devices, various measures have been taken (Jung et al.2022). Currently, electromagnetic waves in the frequency range of 0–400\\xa0GHz are widely used in electronic devices, and EMI spanning from low frequency to the microwave band directly threatens human health while also contributing to a new form of environmental pollution (Cao et al.2010; Sun et al.2017). Electronic science and technology contribute to electromagnetic radiation, which is now considered the fifth most common type of pollution globally, following air, water, noise, and solid waste pollution (Wang et al.2013).',\n",
       "  'In addition to the aerospace, defense, hospital, and home electronics industries, EMI issues are increasingly prevalent in the automotive sector. The production of electric vehicles has experienced a significant and rapid increase, driven by the growing demand for the responsible use of limited natural resources, such as fossil fuels, and the urgent need to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions. Electric automotive components generate strong electromagnetic waves, rendering EMI a particularly serious issue in the automotive industry, where vehicle malfunctions directly impact human safety. With the expanding market for electric vehicles, the EMI shielding market is also expected to grow in the future. Consequently, developing materials that are lightweight, flexible, thermally stable, and have high strength and good corrosion resistance for EMI shielding has become a cutting-edge research area in electronics (Jung et al.2022). With the rapid increase in the number of electric vehicles, PMCs are being increasingly utilized in various applications within the automotive industry (Salifu et al.2022). These modern vehicles rely heavily on sophisticated electronic devices and systems operating at high frequencies ranging from several kHz to a few GHz. Most of these electronic devices and systems ensure the vehicle’s proper functioning in conjunction with sensors. These sensors acquire various types of data and convert them into appropriate electrical signals. Furthermore, the safety of drivers and passengers in these modern vehicles heavily depends on the integrity of the acquired signal. The operation of these high-frequency electronic systems should not be adversely affected, and the integrity of the electrical signal should not be compromised due to electromagnetic noise. Otherwise, the consequences could potentially be catastrophic. Therefore, these electronic systems must be well-protected against electromagnetic noise to maintain their functionality properly (Kim et al.2021).',\n",
       "  'The principle of LSP is to provide a safe conductive path on the outer skin of a composite panel. Ideally, this pathway allows the lightning current to travel through the conductive outer skin and structural components of the aircraft, ultimately exiting through another extremity without causing damage, as illustrated in Fig.2(Goraj2004). In ED-91A by the European Organization for Civil Aviation Equipment, several lightning zones on the aircraft are defined which are predestined for lightning strikes (Fisher and Plumer2022). Current LSP solutions used in commercial aircraft composite structures rely on meshes or foils made from highly conductive metals and alloys. These meshes can be made of aluminum, copper, or bronze wire. They can be integrated as a prepreg or fabric layer woven with carbon fiber or separately bonded to the outer laminate layer (Archambault et al.2016; Welch2007). However, in the case of aluminum mesh, if moisture penetrates the outer skin of the composite, galvanic corrosion can occur (Zhang et al.2013). The risk of galvanic reaction can be particularly severe for metals with low electrode potential. Aluminum is at a higher risk of galvanic corrosion compared to most other metallic materials. Copper mesh eliminates the risk of galvanic reaction but weighs at least twice as much as aluminum (http://www.compositesworld.com/articles/lightning-strike-protection-strategies-for-composite-aircraft [accessed 23 May 2024],n.d.). The general disadvantages of using metal meshes include the added weight to structural elements, manufacturing costs, reduced corrosion resistance, and durability (Zhang et al.2013; Davis et al.2003). Moreover, it is noted that while solutions involving metal meshes or foils mitigate the damage caused by lightning strikes, they do not completely eliminate the problem (Li et al.2018a).',\n",

The goal is to develop an automated technology for metallizing PMCs to protect against lightning strikes (Delloro et al.2021). Moreover, lightning protection of PMCs by thermal spraying is expected to be a promising approach on rotor blades of wind turbines, too. So far, established lightning protection systems, using, e.g., wire meshes, are insufficient, and damages due to delamination or burning are reducing maintenance intervals and thus decreasing the profitability (Yokoyama et al.2012; Yasuda et al.2012).',\n",
       "  'Traditionally, EMI shielding has been addressed by using highly conductive materials such as copper as a shield for the electronic system. Coating copper nanoparticles on flexible substrates can significantly enhance the effectiveness of electromagnetic shielding (Kim et al.2021). In modern vehicles, if traditional methods using metals for shielding are employed, the importance of added mass will increase significantly, given that the number of electronic systems in modern vehicles is several times greater than in traditional vehicles. The solution to this problem may likely involve the use of PMCs. However, since polymer-based materials are dielectric and possess low shielding effectiveness, the signal integrity of sensitive electronic sensor systems becomes vulnerable to EMI, which is unacceptable for modern vehicles (Mostafavi Yazdi et al.2023).',\n",
       "  'As illustrated in Fig.3, the transmission line protection theory considers the electromagnetic wave shield as a transmission line (Singh et al.2018; Zhang et al.2019). When an electromagnetic wave encounters the shielding material, a portion of the wave is reflected off the outer surface, while the remaining part penetrates the shielding material to continue transmission. During transmission, the electromagnetic wave is continuously attenuated by the shielding material and is repeatedly reflected and transmitted at the two interfaces within the shielding material. Therefore, the protection mechanism of EMI shielding materials against electromagnetic waves involves reflection loss (SER) on the surface of the shielding material, absorption loss (SEA) within the shielding material, and loss due to multiple internal reflections (SEM) within the shielding material (Yao et al.2021).',\n",

Consequently, the direct test method is preferred for its convenience, speed, and applicability. This direct method primarily relies on measuring and analyzing characteristic parameters using a vector network analyzer (VNA).

EMI shielding is of great importance in both civilian and military applications. Shielding efficiency between 30 and 60\\xa0dB can meet the requirements for general industrial electronic equipment, while shielding efficiency between 60 and 100\\xa0dB is necessary for precision instruments and military equipment (Yao et al.2021). Shielding requirements vary according to design and environment.

Furthermore, any electronic device designed for military applications must provide the MIL-STD-285 standards. This standard specifies the EMI shielding effectiveness requirements for military devices. Under MIL-STD-285, the minimum effectiveness is 100\\xa0dB for frequencies ranging from 20 to 10,000\\xa0Hz.

       "  'Conventionally, EMI shielding has been achieved using enclosures made of electrically conductive and/or magnetic materials. High EMI SE can be obtained by maximizing the reflection and absorption of electromagnetic waves within the materials. Reflection of electromagnetic waves is achievable with electrically conductive materials. However, absorption is highly dependent on the magnetic and dielectric nature of the shielding materials (Wang et al.2019; Cao et al.2012). Therefore, to enhance the absorption loss of interfering electromagnetic waves, a shielding material must possess adequate conductivity, dielectric permittivity, and magnetic permeability. The development of new EMI shielding materials is a significant focus for researchers as they are increasingly used for the isolation of electrical and electronic devices (Militky and Křemenáková, D., Venkataraman, M., & Vecernik, J.2020; Sang et al.2019). To achieve higher EMI protection, materials with an appropriate combination of electrical conductivity and dielectric and magnetic properties are required (Kumar et al.2021). Thus, finding appropriate methods and effectively controlling electromagnetic pollution are inevitable. Currently, electromagnetic shielding materials include metals (such as Cu, Ni, Ag), inorganic nonmetals (such as graphene, CNTs, MXene), and conductive polymers (such as polyaniline, polypyrrole), which significantly promote the development of electromagnetic shielding technology. Although the aforementioned materials exhibit high EMI shielding effectiveness, they still have noticeable drawbacks. Metal-based electromagnetic shielding materials suffer from disadvantages such as high density, low resistance to corrosion, costly processing, limited performance, and control difficulty. Similarly, conductive polymers face challenges such as processing difficulty and low conductivity (Chen et al.2021). In this regard, the functional division in a metal coating and a polymer-based substrate allows for a beneficial combination of these divergent material property profiles.',\n",
       "  'The metallization of PMCs has been investigated as a promising solution to replace these costly, compulsive, and disadvantageous LSP and EMI shielding materials (Che et al.2017a; Maurer and Schulz2013). Various deposition methods have been explored in this context, including physical vapor deposition (PVD) (Maurer and Schulz2014), chemical vapor deposition (CVD) (Major et al.2019), electroless plating (Zhai et al.2015), and thermal spray techniques (Walsh et al.2015; Gustke et al.2021). However, each of these methods has inherent disadvantages. For example, while PVD and CVD can produce coatings that strongly bond to PMC plates, these techniques involve high equipment and process costs, and they also face limitations in workpiece size/shape and productivity (Rokni et al.2019; Njuhovic et al.2013). Electroplating has long production cycles and environmental hazards. Additionally, thermal spray techniques can potentially damage the structure of the polymeric substrate (Liu et al.2022). Thermal spray processes encompass several techniques such as plasma spraying, wire arc spraying, flame spraying, high-velocity oxygen fuel spraying, and cold spraying. Most of these techniques involve spraying powdered, softened, or molten feedstock material onto a substrate using a gas stream. Upon impact with the substrate, the coating material deforms and then rapidly cools and solidifies (Xu2018). Although thermal spray techniques are commonly used for metallization due to high deposition rates complemented by high possible coating thicknesses, they introduce unwanted heat that can cause severe substrate damage (Gonzalez et al.2016). Conversely, the cold spray method can be used to produce metal coatings by accelerating powdered feedstock at high speeds and relatively low temperatures, achieving supersonic velocities. This results in plastic deformation of the particles upon impact with the substrate. Compared to other mentioned techniques, cold spray offers several advantages, including low-energy input, reduced oxidation, and the production of dense coatings (Nikbakht et al.2018). Particularly, the lower processing temperature significantly reduces substrate damage (Liu et al.2020; Lorenz et al.2018). Therefore, cold spray provides reduced thermal input to the substrate compared to other thermal spray processes, and it also offers cost-effectiveness, portability, and ease of use because the coatings can be applied precisely on designated areas and the necessary process setup enables spraying at field sites as well. In this regard, cold spraying also offers benefits regarding its sustainability as no hazardous chemicals are released due to processing (as, e.g., cyanides in electroplating). By producing oxide-free coatings, cold spray stands out for achieving superior LSP and EMI shielding properties (Gillet et al.2019; Mohankumar et al.2022). In order to avoid a thermal degredation of the polymer substrate, intermediate adhesion-promoting layers can be utilized. So, also materials with high melting points, such as ceramics or refractory metals, can possibly be applied on sensitive substrates by thermal spraying (Guanhong et al.2011; Liu et al.2006).',\n",

Figure5shows the electrical conductivity of copper coatings applied via cold spray (CS), high-velocity oxygen fuel (HVOF), and arc spray (AS), in both as-sprayed and post-deposition annealed conditions. The low process temperature of cold spraying is key to its suitability for achieving denser coatings compared to other thermal spray technologies, resulting in lower oxygen content and, consequently, better conductivity performance.

       "  \"Cold spray is a promising surface engineering technique that enables the deposition of metal coatings onto polymer substrates at low processing temperatures, thereby enhancing the surface properties and functionality of the polymeric material (Parmar et al.2022). However, achieving well-adhered metallic coatings on polymer substrates without causing surface damage remains a challenge (Aghasibeig et al.2024). The cold spraying of metallic feedstock powders onto polymer substrates often results in complex outcomes due to substrate erosion (Zhang et al.2005; Ganesan et al.2012). In recent years, researchers have achieved some success in metallizing polymeric substrates via cold spray using various metals such as tin (Che et al.2017a,2018; Sun et al.2022), iron (Zhang et al.2005), 316L stainless steel (Della Gatta et al.2021; Perna et al.2021), AlSi10Mg (Perna et al.2021; Viscusi et al.2020), copper (Che et al.2017a,2018), aluminum (Lomonaco et al.2019), and even titanium (Gardon et al.2013). Nonetheless, commonly reported issues include substrate damage (Che et al.2017a; Lupoi and O'Neill2010), relatively low deposition efficiencies (DE) (Che et al.2018; Lupoi and O'Neill2010), and layer delamination (Małachowska et al.2017). Also, a few general limitations should be considered. Thus, metallic feedstock materials ought to be ductile as brittle materials will lead to a poor coating formation and inadequate bonding. Also, for the initial deposition onto the PMC substrate, a certain surface roughness is necessary to enable mechanical interlocking. Addressing these issues requires further optimization of process parameters and feedstock materials.\",\n",
       "  \"Lupoi and O'Neill (Lupoi and O'Neill2010) have indicated a correlation between particle impact energy and the deposition of metallic powders. Elements like copper cause substrate erosion due to their high-impact energies, whereas softer elements such as tin and lead can be deposited with some success. Ganesan et al. (Ganesan et al.2013) suggested that soft powders like tin can undergo deformation upon impact, promoting mechanical interlocking, whereas harder particles like copper cannot achieve this. Che et al. (Che et al.2017a) introduced the “crack filling” mechanism, where thermally softened or partially melted tin particles impact the substrate. They hypothesized that the harder core of the particle creates microcracks in the surface epoxy, while the molten part of the tin is squeezed into these cracks, achieving mechanical interlocking with the substrate. They emphasized the importance of dividing the overall coating process of metals on polymeric substrates into two distinct stages: the deposition stage (occurring between the metallic powders and the polymeric substrate) and the build-up stage (occurring between the metallic powders and the previously deposited metal layer) (Che et al.2018). Several research groups have examined the beneficial effects of mixing ceramic powders with metallic feed powders. These improvements are related to increased DE, reduced porosity, enhanced hardness, and improved adhesion strength between the coating and the substrate (Irissou et al.2007; Lee et al.2004).\",\n",

They explained that enhancements in coating properties are associated with the creation of oxide-free surfaces and the peening effect of the SC. Che et al. (Che et al.2017b) observed similar improvements, attributing them to the shot-peening effect of the SC during the spraying of relatively soft tin with zinc or copper SCs. However, recent research conducted by Liberati et al. (Liberati et al.2021) demonstrated that the shot-peening effect might not be an effective mechanism in the case of cold spraying with a mixture of tin and metallic powders. A follow-up study (Liberati et al.2022b) examined the relationship between various SC properties, concluding that coating enhancement is linked to an appropriate SC hardness range and suitable SC impact energy.',\n",

While previous studies focused on understanding the effect of the SC on tin DE, this research aimed to investigate the tensile strength and electrical conductivity of the deposited coatings. It was observed that the polymeric nature of the composite resin influenced the tensile strengths, with ductile thermoplastic PEEK absorbing more of the impact energy from the particles. The tensile strengths were then correlated with SC properties, revealing that better coating strengths were achieved with SCs previously reported to be detrimental to pure tin deposition. Lastly, 4-point resistance/conductivity measurements were performed, and the results were generally better than those previously reported in the literature (50–80% of the bulk tin conductivity), exhibiting variability associated with different bonding qualities within the coatings (Liberati et al.2022a).',\n",
       "  'Concerning the coating formation for dissimilar materials, mechanical interlocking in general and for cold spraying in particular are considered as the main adhesion mechanism. Thus, plasticized spray particles with a high kinetic energy impact on the polymer substrate and mold into undercuts on the surface. With this, particles form characteristic splats, and the coating can grow in layers with subsequent impinging particles clinging to the solidified splats (Majumdar2015). In this regard, the initial geometry of the substrate surface has a major influence of the achievable coating adhesion. Hence, additionally to degreasing, for example, in an ultrasonic ethanol bath, mechanical surface pre-treatments are commonly applied prior to thermal spraying These comprise blasting, laser beam machining, or grinding (Gustke et al.2021; Yin et al.2015; Kromer et al.2018). In this respect, the coating adhesion correlates to roughness parameters or fractal characteristics, respectively (Tillmann et al.2023; Amada and Yamada1996; Hanisch et al.2024). In addition to mechanical interlocking, moreover, other mechanisms for instance quasi-adiabatic shearing, heteroepitaxial growth, or static recrystallization are possible influences on the coating adhesion (Drehmann et al.2018; Viscusi et al.2019).',\n",

Cold spraying onto thermoplastics has been reported to be more successful compared to thermosets (Che et al.2018; Ganesan et al.2013). For instance, many metals, including copper, aluminum, titanium, and tin, have been successfully cold sprayed onto various thermoplastics. Conversely, surface erosion has been identified as a significant issue for thermosets or thermoset matrix composites. Tin is the only metal that can be directly coated onto these materials, offering a narrow coating window (Che et al.2017a,2017b). This difference is attributed to the relatively abrupt thermal softening of thermoplastics around or above their glass transition temperatures (Che et al.2018; Ganesan et al.2013).',\n",

They observed that aluminum deposition occurred alongside erosion. However, due to the low critical velocity of tin, the lower theoretical impact energy resulted in successful deposition. In the case of copper, polymer erosion was identified as the dominant effect. Barletta et al. (Barletta et al.2006) successfully deposited a thin copper coating onto a thermoplastic substrate polyamide (PA66), but erosion occurred after the initial deposition layer, preventing further thickness increase. Ganesan et al. (Ganesan et al.2012) cold sprayed tin and copper (both spherical and dendritic) onto thermoplastic polyvinyl chloride (PVC) substrates and achieved higher DE with tin due to its lower yield strength compared to copper powders. Ganesan et al.

They also investigated the differences in deposition mechanisms on thermoplastic and thermoset substrates, finding that deposition on thermoplastics was possible through mechanical interlocking (particle embedding), whereas localized fracture was observed on thermoset substrates.

Researchers have reported that thermoplastics and thermosets respond differently during the cold spraying of metal powders (Gardon et al.2013; Ganesan et al.2013). The CFRP used in this study has a thermoset matrix. ABS, PEEK, and PEI are thermoplastic polymers with different glass transition temperatures and a range of mechanical properties.

Copper is preferred for applications requiring high electrical conductivity. However, previous studies have shown that continuous copper coatings cannot be directly produced on CFRPs using cold spray. This study conducted by Fallah et al. employed a hybrid manufacturing process to enable the deposition of copper onto CFRPs via cold spray. The schematic representation of this hybrid manufacturing process is shown in Fig.6. The CFRP substrate was first metallized with an electroless Ni coating, followed by electroplating for a thick copper layer onto the Ni interlayer. Copper was then cold sprayed onto both the electroplated CFRP and a copper control panel. The surface and cross-sectional morphologies of the coated CFRP were examined, and the electroplated CFRP and control panels were characterized in terms of mechanical properties and surface roughness before cold spraying. The electrical resistance of the cold-sprayed CFRPs was evaluated. It was found that the DE of copper particles was sensitive to the surface properties of the substrate. The electrical resistance of the cold-sprayed coatings was slightly higher than that of bulk copper due to porosity and minor surface defects in the coating. The results suggested that successful copper coatings could be achieved on CFRPs if a copper interlayer was present. This interlayer not only protected the CFRP from potential damage but also improved the sprayability of copper particles compared to a copper panel. Approximately, five times higher DE was obtained on electroplated CFRP compared to the copper panel, which was attributed to the surface properties of the two substrates. Based on the effect of hardness on DE, it was found that the similarity in hardness between the particles and the substrate allowed simultaneous deformation, promoting plastic deformation at the interface. In the case of electroplated CFRP, the presence of sharper asperities provided a greater contact area with impacting particles, resulting in higher DE compared to the copper panel. Additionally, the lower thermal conductivity of CFRP compared to copper led to heat accumulation in the copper interlayer, softening it and thereby increasing DE. The very low electrical resistance achieved was due to the presence of high-density electroplated and cold-sprayed coatings. Due to the dense hybrid metallic coating, the electrical resistance of the cold-sprayed copper coatings for all spraying conditions was approximately 3.5\\u2009±\\u20090.5 μΩ.cm.

The results indicated that the plastic deformation of the particles, rebound velocity, and kinetic energy increased with the impact velocity. Surface and cross-sectional morphology analyses provided valuable insights for both the cold spray and overplating processes. Adhesion tests revealed that the adhesion strength decreased as the overplating duration and coating thickness increased.

Overall, it was demonstrated that Cu-PEEK mixtures could be deposited onto PEEK under relatively low-pressure cold spray conditions with significantly higher DE compared to the individual spraying of each material alone. Among the tested powder mixture compositions, a nominal 30% Cu volume fraction, corresponding to 74.5% Cu by mass, yielded the highest DE. For each composition, cryomilled composite powders outperformed manually mixed mixtures in terms of both DE and porosity. This combination, along with the decreasing Cu volume fraction, facilitated the embedding and deformation of solid Cu particles without forming porosity. Rebounding particles exhibited a peening effect, allowing further deformation of the PEEK areas and filling any resulting porosity. In contrast, manually mixed mixtures showed significantly less Cu embedding in the deposition surfaces, indicating a higher probability of particle rebound. The successful cold spraying and deposition of Cu-PEEK composite powders enabled the metallization of polymer-rich substrates and structures by forming bonding layers in PEEK matrix composites. This finding suggests the potential for producing stronger, thicker, and better-adhered metallic coatings (Schwenger et al.2024).',\n",

       "  'Cold spraying is a promising process for coating polymers and CFRPs. However, the choice of metal-polymer material pair strongly influences the deposition and properties of the coating. A study conducted by Bortolussi et al. demonstrated that mixing copper and polymer particles leads to composite coatings. It was observed that the polymer promotes coating deposition on CFRP at the cost of electrical conductivity due to the insulating properties of the polymer. This study investigated the effect of coating microstructure on electrical conductivity. Various copper powders with different morphologies, particle sizes, and oxygen contents (spherical oxidized, spherical non-oxidized, and irregular) were mixed with PEEK powder. The cold spraying of these powders resulted in composite coatings, whose microstructures and electrical properties were analyzed in terms of powder characteristics and spraying parameters. Cross-sectional images of the composite coatings, obtained using an optical microscope, are presented in Fig.9. The conductivity of the coatings was experimentally measured for various copper powders. The careful selection of copper and PEEK powder mixtures, combined with optimized spraying parameters, enabled the achievement of metal-polymer coatings with high electrical conductivity on CFRP. This method produced adherent, conductive, and heterogeneous coatings. The metallic component provided electrical properties, while the thermoplastic polymer enhanced the adhesion of metal particles and facilitated the formation of the coating. In the study, the conductivity of each sample was initially tested using a portable ohmmeter, revealing that the coatings containing oxidized spherical copper were completely insulating. Consequently, the focus of conductivity measurements shifted to coatings made with non-oxidized spherical copper and irregular copper powder. Two methods, the 4-point probe technique and the Van der Pauw method, were employed to measure the coatings’ conductivity. The results indicated that coatings containing non-oxidized spherical copper exhibited significantly higher conductivity than those with irregular copper particles. Additionally, the findings demonstrated that thinner coatings, regardless of their composition and morphology, exhibited higher conductivity. The highest conductivity values for coatings containing non-oxidized spherical copper and irregular copper were determined to be 2\\u2009×\\u2009105S.m−1and 2\\u2009×\\u2009103S.m−1, respectively (with the conductivity of bulk copper being 5.9\\u2009×\\u2009107S.m−1whereas PEEK 10−12S.m−1) (Bortolussi et al.2020).',\n",

       "  'This study conducted by Aghasibeig et al. investigated the feasibility of combining cold spray and post-spray coating processes to achieve high copper content in the coatings. The approach involved spraying polyamide-6 (PA6)-Cu powder mixtures for the deposition of composite coatings. This method relies on the formation of a soft polymer matrix that acts as a binder to incorporate hard Cu particles. Using a low-pressure cold spray system, thick composite coatings were successfully deposited onto PA6 substrates. The spray parameters were initially developed for PA6 powder deposition using two nozzle geometries with different expansion section lengths. These optimal conditions were then used to deposit composite coatings containing 30, 50, and 75 vol.% Cu. Increasing the Cu content in the mixture and using the longer nozzle improved the surface smoothness and microstructural homogeneity in cross sections of the coatings. Surface images of the PA6-Cu composite coatings, based on the volumetric copper content and the nozzle geometry used, are presented in Fig.10. The higher copper content at 75 vol.% promoted a compaction effect induced by the impact of hard Cu particles on the previously deposited layer. The compaction effect, combined with the higher particle velocity from the long nozzle, resulted in an increased number of Cu particles retained in the coating, more extensive deformation of deposited Cu particles, and higher cohesive strength of the coating. To further enhance cohesive strength, furnace heating and hot pressing of selected coatings were examined. Both processes were conducted at 215\\xa0°C, below the polymer’s melting point determined by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Furnace heating was performed for 20\\xa0min in air, followed by furnace cooling. Hot pressing used a heated two-plate Carver press at 215\\xa0°C and 400 lbs. The process involved initial heating to 215\\xa0°C without pressure, applying 400-lbs pressure for 2\\xa0min and cooling on the bench. These conditions were optimized to prevent melting or flattening of the samples. The highest cohesive strength and 67–75 vol.% copper content were achieved for coatings sprayed with a PA6-75 vol.% Cu mixture after hot pressing.

       "  'The hybrid cold spray and electroless/electroplating techniques for metallizing polymeric composite materials, such as CFRPs, present promising advancements for enhancing their surface properties and functionality. However, further research and development are essential to fully realize the potential of these techniques and address existing challenges. Future research should explore a wider range of metallic powders and polymer substrates to optimize the hybrid metallization process. Investigating the use of novel alloys and composite materials could lead to coatings with superior mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties. Additionally, exploring the interaction between different metal-polymer combinations will help in understanding the fundamental bonding mechanisms and improving the adhesion and performance of the coatings. Optimizing the process parameters for both cold spray and electroless/electroplating techniques is crucial for achieving consistent and high-quality coatings. Advanced modeling and simulation tools can aid in predicting the behavior of metallic powders during deposition and identifying optimal conditions. Furthermore, scaling up the process for industrial applications requires the development of robust and cost-effective methods. This includes improving the automation of the hybrid metallization process and integrating it into existing manufacturing lines. While this review focused on EMI shielding and LSP, future research should explore other functional properties that can be enhanced through hybrid metallization. These include thermal conductivity, wear resistance, corrosion resistance, and surface hardness. Multifunctional coatings that provide a combination of these properties could open new realms for polymer-based composites in various high-performance applications. Perspectively, multifunctional coatings providing LSP, EMI shielding, resistance against corrosion and/or wear, and other functional properties might be produced in a multi-layer cold-sprayed coating. For this, thermal spraying in general enables the combination of dissimilar materials with divergent properties and is thus suitable to achieve a targeted optimization of coating properties in relation to a complex load regime. The integration of hybrid metallization techniques with emerging technologies such as additive manufacturing (3D printing) and smart materials could lead to innovative solutions for complex engineering challenges. For example, incorporating cold spray and electroless/electroplating into 3D printing processes could enable the creation of metal-polymer composite structures with tailored properties for specific applications. The layer-by-layer deposition capability of 3D printing, combined with the high-deposition-rate and low-temperature advantages of cold spray, can enable the production of multimaterial components with graded or site-specific properties. Future research should explore these hybrid processes to fabricate parts with intricate geometries and multifunctional capabilities, such as integrated electrical conductivity, thermal management, and structural reinforcement. Additionally, the development of smart coatings that respond to environmental stimuli could enhance the functionality and versatility of polymer-based composites. Smart materials, which can adapt or respond to environmental stimuli, present another promising area for integrating cold spray technology. Functional coatings produced via hybrid cold spray-electroless plating could incorporate responsive elements such as piezoelectric, shape-memory, or thermochromic materials. These coatings could be utilized in advanced sensors, self-healing systems, or adaptive structures. Long-term performance and durability are key considerations for the practical application of hybrid metallized coatings. Future studies should include extensive testing under various environmental conditions to evaluate the wear and fatigue resistance of the coatings.

       " 'paper_12.html': ['In recent years, more and more high-performance conductive materials have been extensively investigated owing to the rapid development of electronic devices and electrical equipment [1]. Ideally, superconductors would achieve the highest conductivity. However, since room-temperature superconductivity remains unattainable, copper, as the second most conductive metal after silver, has become widely used in practical applications due to its lower cost and abundant availability [2]. Enhancing the conductivity of copper holds significant importance in improving energy efficiency, reducing costs, decreasing equipment weight, and enhancing overall performance. Consequently, this has become a key research focus in the fields of physics and materials science [3]. Copper can provide exceptional conductivity with the property of high electron density of approximately 1.9\\u2009×\\u20091029electrons m−3[3,4]. However, significant electron–electron scattering in copper results in relatively low electron mobility, about 43 cm2V−1s−1, which limits the potential enhancements in conductivity [5,6]. To overcome this challenge, an innovative approach combining copper with carbon-based nanocomposites has been extensively studied [7]. These composites not only retain the high electron density characteristics of copper but also enhance its conductivity by introducing carbon materials, fully utilizing the unique structural advantages of carbon. They exhibit excellent electrical, mechanical, and chemical properties [8,9], thereby showing great potential for applications in the field of conductive materials [10].',\n",
       "  'Nanocarbon thin films, such as carbon nanotubes and graphene can present great potential for future applications in high-conductivity materials owing to their ultra-high electron mobility, which exceed 10,000 cm2V−1s−1[11,12,13]. Therefore, a strategy of combining copper and nanocarbon film was proposed, in order to enhance the composite’s electrical conductivity significantly and address copper’s mobility limitation [14,15,16]. Numerous developments have been reported on the copper and nanocarbon film combination. In 2012, Kasichainula et al. achieved a 15–17% increase in conductivity when they dispersed graphene oxide into a copper matrix using electrochemical deposition to produce a composite with high conductivity and low resistance [17,18]. In 2014, Xie et al. developed a one-step electrochemical process to synthesize a composite film with excellent electrical contact properties by co-deposited reduced graphene oxide (rGO) and copper. This study showed that the composite’s resistivity was lower than polished copper foil and electroplated copper films, which had 12% increase of conductivity [19]. In 2016, Huang et al. reported a composite film with embedding multilayer graphene into a copper matrix that has enhanced mechanical and electrical properties. The film’s resistivity was 1.66\\u2009×\\u200910−8Ω\\xa0m, around 5% lower than pure copper films [20]. In the same year, Dong et al. demonstrated that the composite has high conductivity (8% increase) and exhibits high hardness by incorporating graphene into W70Cu30composites using mechanical alloying and pressureless infiltration sintering [21]. In 2017, Luo et al. produced a composite with excellent conductivity and mechanical properties by dispersing a silver/reduced graphene oxide (Ag-RGO) mixture into a copper matrix through ball milling and hot-press sintering at 800\\xa0°C. Under 50\\xa0MPa pressure, the conductivity improved by approximately 18.6% [22]. Therefore, it is expected that the incorporation of carbon nanofilms into copper materials can significantly enhance their conductivity.',\n",
       "  'In our previous research, Liu et al. successfully prepared CNTs/Cu composite films using a combination of electrophoresis and electroplating methods [23]. This approach, carbon nanotubes dispersing uniformly within the copper matrix, can enhance electrical performance and reduce resistance by over 20%. This improvement of performance is mainly attributed to the increased grain size in the composite films and the preferential orientation of the Cu (111) crystal plane. The results showed that the CNTs/Cu composite materials exhibited superior electrical properties compared to traditional pure copper films, presenting the possibility for further improvement of interconnect materials in nanoelectronics. However, the specific mechanism of the enhanced conductivity was not thoroughly analyzed. Based on the previous work, we present that the electrical conductivity of multilayer copper–carbon nanofilms can be further optimized by plasma immersion deposition technology. The relationship between the conductivity of the composite material and the thickness of the copper–carbon films was fully investigated. Furthermore, the mechanism of the enhanced conductivity was analyzed including roles of copper atom adsorption sites and electron migration pathways by applying effective medium theory, first-principles calculations and density of states analysis.',\n",
       "  \"Unlike the traditional thin-film deposition methods, such as electrophoresis and electroplating, with the limitation of carbon deposition efficiency, interface quality and scalability for industrial applications [24,25,26], plasma-based thin film deposition technology offers a more efficient and controllable solution to create uniform and high-quality nano-thin film [27,28,29,30]. In 2022, Cech et al. presented that plasma chemistry enables precise control over thin-film properties by adjusting the balance of carbon and silicon species, which directly influences film composition and structure [31]. In 2024, Li et al. reported that the plasma can enhance the adhesion of GLC films, which improves mechanical properties, enhances wear resistance, and effectively reduces the friction coefficient, thereby extends the material's service life [32]. The same year, Wang et al. demonstrated that high-quality films produced by plasma under lower ablation energies, can offer insights for optimizing the deposition process [33]. Otaka et al. achieved high-precision control in film deposition by regulating the physical properties of the films through the control of capacitively coupled plasma [34]. However, how to implement plasma technology in large-scale industrial production still remains a significant challenge [35,36,37].\",\n",

Large-area electrode coating equipment was developed based on this novel approach, which enables industrial application of copper–carbon nanocomposite films in improving copper conductivity and in the field of high conductivity materials.',\n",
       "  \"The copper–carbon multilayer nanofilm composite material in this study was deposited using a carbon layer deposition technique under plasma immersion conditions. The principle of the carbon layer deposition method involves introducing gaseous raw materials into a reaction chamber, where these gases interact under suitable temperature and pressure conditions, leading to the formation of new solid-phase compounds through a series of chemical reactions [38,39,40]. These newly formed compounds subsequently deposit onto the surface of the substrate placed in the reaction chamber, forming a uniform thin film [41]. A major advantage of the plasma immersion deposition technique is its ability to achieve uniform carbon layer deposition over large substrate areas, a feature that supports large-scale equipment development and is particularly crucial for mass production. Moreover, since plasma immersion deposition can be carried out at relatively low temperatures, it is suitable for materials and substrates that cannot withstand high-temperature treatments. By regulating the introduced plasma, the deposition process can be optimized under various conditions, enabling precise control over the carbon layer’s properties, including enhanced uniformity, increased material purity, and adjustable microstructure. Introducing plasma into the carbon layer deposition process provides a large number of active particles in the deposition chamber, significantly improving the uniformity and compactness of the copper surface nano-carbon film [42,43].

This allows for efficient deposition in a short time, enhancing process efficiency. Moreover, the plasma density in the negative glow region is relatively uniform, enabling the formation of consistent film thickness on the substrate surface, which is crucial for many high-precision applications.',\n",
       "  'Of course, excessively high plasma density during carbon layer deposition under plasma immersion conditions may also lead to some negative effects, such as uneven deposition rates affecting the overall performance of the interface layer or incomplete gas-phase reactions due to excessive temperature caused by high plasma density.

The reason for conducting surface carbon layer material tests based on copper thin films is that the parameters during magnetron sputtering allow for control over the thickness of the copper film. This enables an investigation of the conductivity changes when both the copper layer and the carbon film layer are thin, as well as the specific changes when the copper layer thickness increases. This further helps explore the bonding state of the copper–carbon interface layer.

However, after high-temperature annealing, the carbon atoms bonded more tightly with the copper atoms on the copper foil surface, enhancing the interaction between the atoms. Additionally, the increased orderliness of the nanocarbon film, with the hexagonal-like structure becoming more prominent, further improved the conductivity [23,44].',\n",

Since the copper films were prepared by magnetron sputtering, variations in the growth process can affect the contact quality of the interface layer between the copper and the nanocarbon film. A thinner copper film (750\\xa0nm) can form better interfacial adhesion and create a network structure of electron transport channels, resulting in lower interface resistance.

       "  'From a theoretical perspective, when an ordered nanocarbon film grows on a copper film, the copper film provides a large number of transferable electrons, and the distribution of copper and carbon atoms in the composite nanofilm material forms a network structure. Due to the quasi-one-dimensional structure of the nanocarbon film and the staggered arrangement of the charge densities in its highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO), channels that are more conducive to electron transport are formed. A significant number of electrons from the copper film in contact with the nanocarbon film migrate to it, ultimately leading to an improvement in the conductivity of the copper–carbon composite material. In the initial stages, as the copper film thickness increases, surface roughness decreases, allowing the nanocarbon film to cover the copper surface more uniformly. This promotes the formation of a network structure and reduces scattering during electron transport, thereby enhancing conductivity. However, when the copper film reaches a certain thickness (around 625\\xa0nm), further increases in copper thickness result in diminishing marginal benefits from the additional electron transport channels provided by the nanocarbon film, leading to a decrease in the rate of improvement. Additionally, the internal structural complexity of the film increases, and an excessively thick copper film can lead to increased stress within the interface layer, affecting the structure and conductivity of the nanocarbon film in contact with it. Therefore, the conductivity enhancement effect of the nanocarbon film begins to weaken after the copper film reaches a certain thickness. For copper films with a thickness of 625\\xa0nm, the growth of the nanocarbon film reaches an optimal balance, resulting in the most significant improvement in conductivity.',\n",

Nanocarbon films were grown in different batches for total times of 5, 10, 15, and 20\\xa0min, corresponding to thicknesses of 25, 50, 75, and 100\\xa0nm, respectively, and resistance were measured. The results are shown in Fig.2h, i.',\n",
       "  'As shown in Fig.2i, with the increase in total carbon layer deposition time under plasma immersion conditions, the overall conductivity gradually improves. However, the rate of conductivity improvement decreases as the thickness of the nanocarbon film increases, generally exhibiting a logarithmic trend. This phenomenon is also validated in the effective medium analysis section later as well. For the multilayer copper–carbon film samples with a total thickness of 625\\xa0nm and a width of 5\\xa0mm, when the total carbon layer deposition time is 20\\xa0min (corresponding to three layers of 175\\xa0nm copper film and two layers of 50\\xa0nm carbon film, with the carbon film accounting for 16% of the total thickness), the resistance is reduced by 30.20% compared to a pure copper film of the same thickness.',\n",
       "  'The underlying mechanism behind this change in the magnitude of improvement can be explained by the principle of how nanocarbon films enhance the conductivity of copper materials. When carbon atoms in the nanocarbon film interact with surface copper atoms, they form a highly ordered network structure, providing smoother pathways for electron transport. As the thickness of the nanocarbon film increases, this highly ordered network structure expands, thereby enhancing electron mobility. In addition, a thicker nanocarbon film can more effectively cover surface irregularities of the copper substrate, reducing scattering during electron transport and further improving conductivity. However, once the nanocarbon film reaches a certain thickness, its marginal effect on conductivity improvement begins to decrease. Additionally, increasing the thickness of the carbon layer also reduces the copper content per unit volume. According to the research previously conducted by our group [23], the copper–carbon ratio affects the overall material’s grain size and crystal plane peak size. Furthermore, as the improvement in conductivity is based on a comparison with pure copper films of the same thickness, the conductive properties of the composite material are influenced not only by the high electron mobility of the carbon film but also by the contribution of electrons from the copper film. Therefore, the thickness of the carbon film needs to be optimized to find the best balance between improving conductivity and maintaining sufficient copper content in practical applications. Guided by theoretical analysis and validated by experiments, when the total deposition time of the carbon film is 20\\xa0min, including two layers of 50\\xa0nm thick carbon films, the 625\\xa0nm thick\\xa0multilayer copper–carbon composite nanofilms exhibits the most significant improvement in conductivity, achieving the best enhancement compared to pure copper material, with an improvement rate of 30.20%.',\n",

The conductivity of a conductor is formed by the directional movement of electrons under the influence of an external field. Copper, as a good conductor, has a diffuse distribution of electronic wave functions within it. When copper material is combined with a nano-carbon film, it affects the distribution of local electrons, thereby impacting the overall conductivity on a macroscopic scale [50].

When an electric field is applied, the charge distribution around the copper atom appears more sparse compared to the case without the field, and the wave function is noticeably reduced. Similarly, the wave function distribution around the carbon atoms in the copper–carbon bond is also significantly reduced.

The self-limiting nature of ALD allows for conformal film deposition without pinholes, enabling precise control of film thickness by adjusting the number of deposition cycles. In 2022, Xie et al. prepared a lightweight, flexible, and ferromagnetic material called graphene quartz fiber fabric (FGQF) using CVD74.

       "  'Electromagnetic absorbing metamaterials are synthetic materials designed to effectively absorb electromagnetic waves and convert electromagnetic energy into other forms, such as heat84. However, the surfaces of most objects that require electromagnetic shielding or protection from electromagnetic interference are often irregular, and electromagnetic waves can be incident from various directions. To address this, conformable electromagnetic metamaterial absorbers using flexible substrates have been developed. As the name suggests, flexible electromagnetic absorbing metamaterials possess toughness and can conform to the surfaces of irregular objects. Unlike traditional electromagnetic absorbing metamaterials, these flexible variants can be easily adhered to various complex surfaces, providing superior adaptability.',\n",
       "  'The flexibility in electromagnetic metamaterials is typically achieved through the dielectric isolation layer within their three-layer structure. In 2008, N. I. Landry pioneered the design and realization of a metamaterial absorber featuring a sandwich structure85,86. This absorber consists of three layers: an upper electric resonant ring that facilitates electric field coupling, a middle dielectric layer, and a lower metal wire. When exposed to an incident wave, the electric resonant ring and the lower metal wire generate antiparallel currents, providing magnetic field coupling. The electric and magnetic resonances within the metamaterial absorber can be tuned by adjusting the size parameters of each layer and the periodic arrangement of the resonant ring. The dielectric constant and magnetic permeability exhibit large imaginary components, ensuring impedance matching and a high absorption rate for electromagnetic waves. The middle layer, composed of a flexible, bendable, and conformal dielectric material, offers both toughness and wave absorption capabilities. This makes it particularly advantageous for covering irregular surfaces to absorb electromagnetic waves, and it also enhances the absorption of waves incident at large angles.',\n",

This allows absorbers to achieve functional characteristics such as ultra-narrowband87, multi-band88, broadband89, cross-band90, flexibility91, transparency92, or tunability93. Additionally, most flexible electromagnetic metamaterials are composed of periodic units with microstructures arranged in a plane.

Since then, numerous designs and modulations of electromagnetic metamaterials across different bands have been proposed by researchers, emerging rapidly and abundantly.',\n",
       "  'The microwave band (0.3–300\\u2009GHz) is the most commonly used frequency range in modern wireless network systems, communications, radar, and other fields. It is characterized by penetration, heating selectivity, low thermal inertia, non-ionization, and information transmission. Flexible electromagnetic metamaterial absorbers, being sub-wavelength structures, typically operate in the millimeter scale within the microwave band, which makes them cost-effective to produce. This is currently one of the most important areas of research. The working wavelength can be controlled by adjusting the scale of the flexible electromagnetic metamaterial structure. When the scale of the metamaterial absorber reaches the micrometer or nanometer level, it can absorb terahertz and infrared waves through careful design and arrangement. The terahertz band, with wavelengths ranging from 30\\u2009µm to 3000\\u2009µm and a frequency range of 0.1\\u2009THz–10\\u2009THz, shares similarities with both microwave and optical theories, but also possesses unique properties. Terahertz waves exhibit both electronic and optical characteristics, leading to high penetration, particularly through non-metallic materials, and high resolution, which allows for microscopic imaging with excellent clarity. The infrared spectrum, typically covering the frequency range of 300\\u2009GHz–430\\u2009GHz, is characterized by high frequency and short wavelength. Metamaterial absorbers that function in the terahertz and infrared bands often have a period scale in the hundreds of nanometers. In the infrared band, metamaterials usually employ artificially designed microstructures made of metals or insulators to manipulate electromagnetic waves. With the advancement of multi-spectral composite detection technology, cross-band flexible electromagnetic metamaterials have begun to emerge. The design of these metamaterials focuses on absorbing high-frequency microwaves and sub-terahertz waves, or near-infrared, high-frequency terahertz, and visible light. However, there is currently some overlap in the operational frequency domains, and it remains challenging to achieve microwave-terahertz-infrared cross-frequency absorption with a single material or unit array. Most designs involve multi-layer or stacked structures, with narrow bandwidth or extremely low operational bandwidth.',\n",

Reflection is a common phenomenon in daily life. In nature, many objects cannot emit light on their own. What allows us to see these objects is that the human eye can perceive the visible light reflected from them. Currently, there are two main methods for stealth mechanisms based on metamaterials1: A reflective ultrathin stealth suit can be used, which manipulates the reflected wavefront by covering a layer of metamaterials on a folded reflective surface to simulate the reflected wavefront of a smooth mirror; however, specular reflection is achieved with this method2. An absorption-radiation-type ultrathin stealth suit can be used. It involves absorbing the incident wave with a lossy metamaterials, followed by radiating and adjusting the wavefront with a gainful metamaterials. Tuning the gain is the main challenge of this approach. Furthermore, a composite ultrathin cloak is utilized to achieve the stealth effect. In this case, the stealth effect can be achieved by using a transmissive metamaterials to couple the incident electromagnetic wave into a zero-refractive index material149. The electromagnetic wave then passes through the tunnel to the outgoing end and is controlled by the transmissive metamaterials. One of the main challenges of this method is the realization of zero refractive index materials150. For low-loss materials such as dielectrics, a new stealth method involves the use of metamaterials to allow the incident wave to pass directly through the dielectric surface without reflection or refraction. By allowing the wave to pass directly through the entire object, the dielectric effect can be achieved151. Figure8shows the application of flexible electromagnetic absorption metamaterials.',\n",

Additionally, shielding materials can absorb the energy of electromagnetic waves, achieving a shielding effect. Materials contain specific components or structures that absorb electromagnetic waves and convert their energy into other forms. During the absorption process, electromagnetic waves are attenuated, which improves the material’s shielding effectiveness. A material’s shielding effectiveness rating index, or SE, reflects its ability to block electromagnetic waves. Typically, materials with higher shielding effectiveness values provide better protection against electromagnetic waves.

Given the intricate and continual movements of the human body, devising a robustly deformable material capable of withstanding diverse motion frequencies and amplitudes poses a significant challenge\\xa0[3]. A commonly pursued strategy involves reducing material thickness, recognized as a generic approach to mitigate strain-induced structural cracks and bolster intrinsic deformability. For instance, in the context of the simplest one-dimensional bendable bio-devices employed on the wrist and fingers, the bending strain (ε) could be quantified as\\\\(\\\\varepsilon = {\\\\text{t}}/(2{\\\\text{R}} + {\\\\text{t}})\\\\), wheretdenotes thickness andRsignifies bending radius\\xa0[83]. Reducing thickness from the micrometer scale typical of conventional metal or organic films to sub-nanometer dimensions achievable with 2D drastically alleviates strain concerns in biodevices by orders of magnitude. The reduction in dimensions and the increase in specific surface area of sensing materials can amplify their optical, electrical, and chemical properties. Therefore, low-dimensional nanomaterials with a high surface-to-volume ratio provide higher sensitivity and lower detection limits in sensing applications. For instance, atomic-layer-thick chemical vapor deposition (CVD) graphene shows strong σ bonds formed by in-plane sp2hybridization, while the remaining p orbitals create a delocalized π electron structure, resulting in in-plane electrical conductivity that is several orders of magnitude higher than the conductivity in the vertical direction\\xa0[84]. Consequently, the high conductivity of graphene enables outstanding performance in electronic devices, particularly in pressure sensors with rapid response times. For instance, Zhang et al. reported highly sensitive flexible pressure sensors based on CVD graphene that demonstrated high sensitivity ranging from 0 (kPa)−2under pressures of 110–1.0\\xa0kPa\\xa0[85].

The nanometer-scale thickness of the 2D monolayer enables its conformable attachment with a nearly arbitrary surface. Secondly, 2D monolayers generally possess remarkably high elasticity. The exceptionally high Young's modulus (ranging from 200 to1,000 GPa) and elastic strain limit (up to 20%) empower the 2D monolayer to maintain structural integrity under significant external strain\\xa0[58].

The development of manufacturing technologies for high-quality, low-cost, and large-scale 2D materials is a crucial aspect of advancing bio-flexible sensors. However, there are currently no effective strategies to control the size and thickness of 2D materials synthesized through hydrothermal synthesis and mechanical exfoliation. Mainstream preparation strategies for large-area 2D materials include CVD, physical vapor deposition (PVD), and molecular beam epitaxy (MBE).

Promisingly, efforts have focused on enhancing quality while balance scalable fabrication in the wet exfoliation process. For instance, while liquid-phase exfoliation of 2D materials has long been considered a scalable and cost-effective method for producing nanosheets with good solution processability, the limited control over structural defects in as-synthesized 2D flakes remains a significant barrier for their application in high-performance devices\\xa0[355].

       " 'paper_15.html': ['With the continuous development of laser technology, the absorption performance of film components within laser systems has become increasingly important. During a long period of high-power continuous laser irradiation, a weak absorption loss causes the conduction and accumulation of heat from the light energy in a film. Thus, the surface temperature of the film rises, which can cause a certain degree of melting or changes in the material characteristics and optical properties, ultimately resulting in damage to the film components. Furthermore, heat deposition from absorption can distort film components, resulting in poor beam quality. Therefore, laser films with ultralow absorption are crucial for high-power laser systems such as laser weapons1,2,3, laser inertial confinement fusion (ICF) systems4,5,6,7,8, and high-precision measurement systems, including gravitational wave detection9,10,11and laser gyroscope systems12,13.',\n",

Among these methods, IAD and bombarding a film with an oxygen ion beam improve the structural defects in the film and better replenish the oxygen loss of the source material, thus reducing the oxygen vacancy defects in the film, which plays an important role in decreasing its absorption loss.',\n",
       "  'The absorption loss of a film is mainly due to absorption during the deposition process, considerably influenced by process parameters such as the ion source voltage and current, oxygen flow rate, auxiliary gases, and substrate temperature. In particular, the oxygen flow rate directly affects the stoichiometric ratio of an optical oxide film. Zhang et al.21used an IAD method to control the absorption of Ta2O5films by adjusting the oxygen flow rate and substrate temperature, which produced films with reasonable optical properties in the near-infrared region. Liu et al.22investigated the effects of the process parameters on the optical band gap of Ta2O5films and found that the oxygen flow rate had the most effect on the forbidden bandwidth. A higher oxygen flow rate improved the forbidden bandwidth of the films—the key to preparing ultralow-loss films. Chen et al.23used two different molecular oxygen flows and four different ionic oxygen flows to study the effect of the ionic oxygen concentrations and oxygen flow rates on the optical properties of Ta2O5films. With an increase in the ionic oxygen concentration, the refractive index first increased and then decreased. The extinction coefficient of Ta2O5films with 25sccm O2+were much higher than those of Ta2O5films with 30, 35, and 40sccm O2+. The extinction coefficient of the last three groups of samples exhibited little difference. In IAD, an ion beam is emitted by ionizing pure oxygen in the ion source, known as ionic oxygen. This process significantly affects the properties of ultralow-absorption films. Although ionic oxygen can increase the oxidizing capacity and reduce the oxygen vacancy defects, bombarding films with an ion beam stream may also selectively sputter out the oxygen in the films, leading to new oxygen vacancy defects. Thus, when using different IAD processes for dielectric films, the absorption performance is not positively correlated with the oxygen concentration; hence, an optimal concentration exists, which has not been extensively studied. Thus, conducting absorption studies of films deposited with the assistance of different ion-source oxygen flow rates is necessary.',\n",

       "  'Furthermore, some studies display a positive affirmation bias, where only those patients that have presented for surgical excision after failed laser therapy are seen [5]. This may fail to capture individuals who have had successful treatment with laser therapy and have never presented for surgical excision. Additionally, surgery carries the risk of scarring, infection and ulceration, and in some cases multiple surgeries are required to fully excise the lesion due to size or recurrence. Recurrence post-surgery can be as high as 33% in larger lesions (2\\xa0cm-7\\xa0cm) and may require skin graft [3]. Medical treatment of VVMs has included topical sirolimus, however this carries the disadvantages of side effects and frequent blood monitoring requirements [6].',\n",
       "  'The mechanism by which laser treats VVMs is related to the absorption of radiation and the conversion of radiation into heat. This occurs when the radiation is absorbed by a chromophore. In the case of VVMs, haemoglobin is the chromophore abundant in blood vessels supplying the lesion, thus allowing the radiation to be absorbed and destroy the blood vessel. Haemoglobin will selectively absorb light at 595\\xa0nm and 1064\\xa0nm, the wavelength used in PDL and PDL-Nd:YAG, and using short pulse widths leads to selective photo-thermolysis confined to the abnormal vessel [7].',\n",

Previous research also supports that PDL can treat superficial lesions, but effects are limited in more verrucous lesions, and PDL-Nd:YAG is preferred for deeper verrucous lesions [4].

It should be noted, however, that this study included only a paediatric population group, and significant differences may be found when including a broader age range. One case report of a 53-year-old patient with a VVM, showed a much greater degree of hyperkeratosis as the VVM likely progressed [11]. Laser in such a case may be of limited benefit and the utility of lasers in adults, while should be explored, does not dismiss the fact that early laser treatment is of benefit and can prevent or minimise surgical intervention. Thus, reducing associated complications with surgery and improving cosmetic outcomes.',\n",

However, this study finds that second pass treatment using PDL after PDL-Nd:YAG does not provide better outcomes. A limitation of this study in drawing this conclusion is that laser fluence and mean Joules delivered by PDL second pass was not evaluated separately from those delivered by PDL as a component of PDL-ND:YAG. Furthermore, confounding factors influencing results include, skin type and depth of the lesion, which were not included in our analysis.

Our methodology includes tools for assessing response that can be used in future work for comparison. Furthermore, bias was minimised by using two independent reviewers, who were not involved in the patients’ care and thus blinded to the treatment received, improving the validity of the results [13].

Clinical assessment and treatment response determined the number of treatments offered and duration between successive sessions.

       " 'paper_17.html': ['Plasmonics is an emerging field of nanophotonics that addresses the demands of ultra-compact as well as ultra-fast devices1,2. It deals with the resonant interaction of light with free electrons in metallic nanostructures, resulting in surface plasmon resonance (SPR), i.e., excitation of propagating surface plasmons at the metal-dielectric interface3, or localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR), i.e., confinement of plasmons within nanoparticles of sub-wavelength volume4. Plasmonics has been widely employed to develop advanced photonic devices such as modulators5, absorbers6, polarizers7, amplifiers8, splitters9, filters10, and switches11. Among these, plasmonic switches—which are optical devices to control the flow of optical signals—are extensively used for various applications in telecommunication networks, optical communications, logic circuits, integrated photonic circuits, super-resolution imaging, quantum computing networks, and neural networks12,13,14.',\n",
       "  'Over the decades, many physical effects such as thermo-optic effect15, electro-optic effect16, all-optic effect17, acousto-optic effect18, free carrier dispersion effect19, Pockels effect20, and phase change effect21have been employed to achieve switching with plasmonic nanostructures. However, phase change materials (PCMs)—which undergo reversible electronic and structural transitions on exposure to external stimuli—have been widely used due to ultra-fast switching speed, high degree of scalability, high latent heat values, dynamic tuning, low power consumption, and low cost22,23. Although various PCMs such as—oxides of vanadium24, germanium-antimony-tellurium (GeSbTe or GST)25, and silver-indium-antimony-tellurium (AgInSbTe or AIST)26—have been proposed in the last two decades to develop plasmonic switches, in this paper, we have used vanadium dioxide (VO2) as the phase change material owing to its numerous advantages such as near-room transition temperature, ultra-fast switching speed, low thermal hysteresis, and potential to withstand millions of switching cycles without degradation27,28. VO2is a phase change material which undergoes a phase transition from a monoclinic semiconductor state to a tetragonal metal state when exposed to an external stimulus such as – a thermal trigger, an electrical trigger, or an optical trigger. VO2based thermally triggered plasmonic switches generally have a phase transition temperature of∼68 °C29but the transition temperature can be modulated with doping30,31. Electrically triggered plasmonic switches based on VO2can be activated on the application of electric field of∼107Vm−\\u2009132or a switching voltage of∼1.3 V33to∼6 V34. Optically triggered VO2based plasmonic switches exhibit phase transition by employing optical energy at picosecond to femtosecond timescales35. It is well established that, in its metallic tetragonal phase, the crystal structure of VO2is formed by vanadium atoms in the center of an edge-shared oxygen octahedra such that vanadium atoms are equally separated by 2.85\\\\(\\\\:\\\\dot{A}\\\\)from each other. When VO2undergoes a phase transition from its tetragonal (R) to its semiconductor monoclinic phase, it is characterized by an orthorhombic distortion of the octahedra that causes the formation of different axial and equatorial V-O bonds. The vanadium ions form pairs which lead to alternative V-V distances of 2.65\\\\(\\\\:\\\\dot{A}\\\\)and 3.12\\\\(\\\\:\\\\dot{A}\\\\)36. The mechanism of the first order transition in VO2from its semiconductor state to its metal state has previously been explained as a structure distortion driven Peierls transition37, an electron correlation driven Mott transition38, or as a combination of the two mechanisms39. Based on the work by multiple research groups36,37,38,39, it has been found that the transition primarily involves an interplay of lattice distortion and electronic correlation, thus suggesting the role of both Mott and Peierls transitions in understanding the complete behavior of the phase transition of VO2. Previously, Chen et al.40found that the phase transition is a staged electron correlation driven Mott transition followed by a structure driven Peierls transition. More recently, Grandi et al.41suggested that the transition is a two-step process involving a phase change from the monoclinic insulator to an intermediate monoclinic metal phase, followed by the transformation of the monoclinic metal into a rutile metal phase. Thus, it can be concluded that the phase transition is caused by an interplay of the interactions between the lattice structure, electron correlations and orbitals. This transition is accompanied by massive changes in the refractive index of VO2, leading to significant changes in its optical properties.',\n",
       "  'Although many VO2based plasmonic switches have been developed in the past42, there have been limited reports of plasmonic switches showing multi-wavelength switching operation (i.e., simultaneous switching operation at more than one wavelength) as well as polarization-independent switching (i.e., same switching efficiency at any polarization angle of incident light). Multi-wavelength switching is important as a single switch can operate at multiple wavelengths with almost the same switching efficiency, thus, eliminating the need of different switches for different operational wavelengths. In addition, polarization independence allows the switch to be used with un-polarized light, thus alleviating the need to employ a polarizer. Among the few reports of multi-wavelength switching in the past, Rashidi et al.43proposed switchable VO2embedded photonic crystals that displayed six resonant peaks with absorption\\u2009~\\u20090.6 in the near-infrared (NIR) regime. Sharma et al.44proposed gold nano-gratings coated with VO2that exhibited a maximum differential reflectance of ~\\u200941%. Dalal et al.45proposed identical V-shaped nanostructures based multi-wavelength plasmonic switches using VO2that demonstrated an extinction ratio of ~\\u200914 dB at two wavelengths—1320\\xa0nm and 2800\\xa0nm. In addition, single wavelength polarization independence has been proposed by Long et al.46using a VO2metasurface that exhibited a high emittance of ~\\u20090.95 at 5\\xa0μm for multiple polarization angles from 0° to 180°. However, it must be noted that in all these previous reports, both polarization-independent and multi-wavelength switching has not been reported simultaneously. In addition, for the few reports on multi-wavelength switching, the extinction ratios for the switches have remained well below 15 dB.',\n",
       "  'In this paper, we have proposed VO2based polarization-independent and dual-wavelength plasmonic switches using a periodic combination of U and C shaped gold nanostructures on a gold coated silicon dioxide (SiO2) substrate with a thin VO2film spacer between the nanostructures and the underlying plasmonic substrate (see Fig.1a). The U and C shaped nanopillars are placed on the underlying substrate such that there is a spatial offset between them (see Fig.1a). The spatial offset is defined as the distance between the axis passing through the center of U shaped nanostructure (au) and the axis passing through the center of C shaped nanostructure (ac). It is well known that when three nanopillars are arranged in a U shaped nanostructure, two plasmonic modes—a short wavelength mode and a long wavelength mode—are generated when the incident light is X-polarized (i.e., polarization angle ‘ϕ’ = 0°), whereas a single plasmonic mode is generated when the incident light is Y-polarized (i.e., polarization angle ‘ϕ’ = 90°)47.',\n",
       "  'For the C shaped nanostructure, this situation becomes inverted, with two plasmonic modes being excited for Y-polarized light and one plasmonic mode being excited for X-polarized light. However, when both U and C shaped nanostructures are placed together to form a U-C type plasmonic switch, two plasmonic modes—a short wavelength mode and a long wavelength mode—are generated for both X- and Y-polarized incident light. Due to the excitation of two plasmonic modes at both polarization angles of incident light, these U-C type plasmonic nanostructures are employed in this paper to realize an efficient polarization-independent multi-wavelength switch by placing them on a VO2coated plasmonic substrate as shown in Fig.1. As VO2changes from its monoclinic semiconductor state to tetragonal metal state while exposed to an external stimulus (see Fig.1a), it undergoes a change in its refractive index, leading to a significant change in the overall plasmonic response of the switch. The transformation of VO2leads to a change in the plasmon resonance wavelengths of both the plasmonic modes, thus leading to efficient simultaneous switching at two wavelengths. The switching ability of the proposed plasmonic switches is analyzed in terms of extinction ratio (ER)—which is the ratio of the reflectance from the switch when VO2is in its metal state (i.e., OFF state) to the reflectance from the switch when VO2is in its semiconductor state (i.e., ON state). The proposed U-C type plasmonic switches exhibit an ER of ~\\u200920 dB simultaneously at two wavelengths—at ~\\u20091560\\xa0nm and at ~\\u20092130\\xa0nm—for a linearly polarized incident light with any polarization angle from 0° to 90° as shown in Fig.1b. The tunability of the wavelengths of maximum ER is also demonstrated in this paper by optimizing the various geometric parameters of the proposed switches such as the gap ‘G’ between the adjacent U and C shaped nanostructures, the thickness of VO2film ‘t’, and the aspect ratio ‘AR’—which is the ratio of the length ‘L’ of the nanopillars to the width ‘W’ of the nanopillars (see Fig.1a).',\n",

       "  'In order to understand the working principles of the U-C type plasmonic switch proposed in this paper, a preliminary discussion of the building units of the proposed switch, i.e., the polarization dependent U shaped and C shaped plasmonic switches is necessary. The U shaped or the C shaped nanostructures can be viewed as two parallel nanopillars connected through a bottom bridging nanopillar. Figure2a shows a schematic of the VO2based periodic U shaped plasmonic switch, where the length of U shaped nanopillars ‘L’, the width of U shaped nanopillars ‘W’, the height of U shaped nanopillars ‘H’, the gap ‘G’ between adjacent U shaped nanostructures, and the thickness of VO2film ‘t’ is taken to be 100\\xa0nm, 20\\xa0nm, 50\\xa0nm, 30\\xa0nm, and 100\\xa0nm, respectively. Figure2b shows the reflectance spectra of U shaped plasmonic switch with VO2in its semiconductor and metal states for X-polarized (‘ϕ’ = 0°) and Y-polarized (‘ϕ’ = 90°) incident light. It can be observed from Fig.2b that when X-polarized light is incident on the U shaped nanostructures with VO2in its semiconductor state (i.e., VO2(S)), two longitudinal modes are primarily excited at wavelengths of 1320\\xa0nm and 2630\\xa0nm, respectively. These two modes can be well explained by the plasmon hybridization theory58. With smaller values of gap between the adjacent U shaped nanopillars, the hybridization of the elementary plasmons of the U shaped nanopillars results in the splitting of the dipolar mode into a bonding mode (longer wavelength mode), and an antibonding mode (shorter wavelength mode). Further, as the VO2film is switched from its semiconductor state to its metal state, a blue-shift in the plasmon resonance wavelength is observed such that the plasmonic modes shift to 790\\xa0nm and 1290\\xa0nm, respectively. This shift in the plasmonic modes supported by the U shaped nanostructures upon phase transformation of the underlying VO2layer can be understood by effectively modelling the proposed switch as a U shaped nanopillar array placed on top of a substrate with an effective dielectric permittivity,\\\\(\\\\:{\\\\epsilon\\\\:}_{eff}\\\\). As a thick gold layer is present on top of the SiO2layer, the substrate can be treated equivalent to a layer of VO2on top of a gold substrate. The effective medium constants can then be modelled using the well-known Bruggeman’s effective medium approximation59. The calculation of the effective permittivity of the substrate is shown in Supplementary Information, Note2. It can be observed from the effective dielectric constants shown in Fig.S2d (See Supplementary Information, Note2) that as the VO2layer transforms from its semiconductor state to its metal state, there is a decrease in the real part of the dielectric permittivity of the effective substrate under the U shaped nanopillars, thus leading to a blue-shift of the plasmon resonance wavelengths1. Further, it should be noted that the imaginary part of the effective dielectric permittivity for the VO2-Au substrate increases as VO2transforms from a semiconductor state to its metal state, thus leading to a higher loss which can be seen as the reduction in the magnitude of plasmon coupling leading to a smaller dip in the reflectance spectra of the switch with VO2(M). This case, with VO2(M), can also be explained by a parallel theory based on plasmon hybridization and charge transfer60. In such cases where metal nanostructures capable of plasmon hybridization are present on a metallic substrate (VO2(M)-Au substrate), the incident light induces a strong coupling between the adjacent U shaped nanopillars giving rise to a screened bonding dimer (SBD) plasmon resonance at 790\\xa0nm with a strong dipolar character. In addition, for such metal nanostructure on metal systems, the presence of the conductive surface (VO2(M) on Au) underneath the U shaped nanopillars, induces a net charge transfer between the nanopillars often leading to a charge transfer mode (CTP) at a higher wavelength. However, due to substrate screening, electric dipole moment of the CTP mode (~\\u20091290\\xa0nm) is often screened, making it sub-radiant and hidden within the spectra. On the other hand, it can also be observed from Fig.2b that when the incident light is polarized in the Y direction, only one longitudinal mode is excited at wavelength of 2100\\xa0nm with VO2(S). Similar to the X-polarized case, when the VO2film is switched from its semiconductor state to its metal state, this plasmonic mode is blue-shifted to 1040\\xa0nm. It must be noted that the dips corresponding to the longitudinal modes in the reflectance spectra of the U shaped plasmonic switch with VO2(S) appear as peaks in the ER spectra of the switch (see Fig.2c). It must also be noted that the plasmonic switch can operate in both the ER regimes, i.e., the positive ER regime where\\\\(\\\\:{R}_{M}\\\\left(\\\\lambda\\\\:\\\\right)\\\\)>\\\\(\\\\:{R}_{S}\\\\left(\\\\lambda\\\\:\\\\right)\\\\)and the negative ER regime where\\\\(\\\\:{R}_{M}\\\\left(\\\\lambda\\\\:\\\\right)\\\\)<\\\\(\\\\:{R}_{S}\\\\left(\\\\lambda\\\\:\\\\right)\\\\). However, we have chosen only the positive ER regime to carry out the comprehensive analysis of the switching performance of all the proposed plasmonic switches in this paper as this regime overlaps with the conventionally employed and futuristic communication bands.',\n",
       "  'Figure2c shows that for an X-polarized light, maximum ER is achieved at two distinct wavelengths—an ER of ~\\u20098 dB at a short wavelength (ERX−SW) of 1320\\xa0nm and an ER of ~\\u200921 dB at a long wavelength (ERX−LW) of 2630\\xa0nm. In contrast, for a Y-polarized light, maximum ER of ~\\u20096 dB is observed at a single wavelength (ERY) of 2100\\xa0nm. It must be noted that although switching is obtained at two different wavelengths for X-polarized light, this switch cannot truly be called a dual-wavelength switch because the magnitude of ER at both the wavelengths (i.e., ~ 8 dB at 1320\\xa0nm and ~\\u200921 dB at 2630\\xa0nm) is not equal. The charge density profiles for the U shaped plasmonic switch, with both X- and Y-polarized light, are shown in Fig.2d at the resonance wavelengths of the reflectance spectra of the switch with VO2(S) and VO2(M). Further, to show the ON and OFF states of the switch, the electric field profiles of the U shaped plasmonic switch with VO2(S) and VO2(M) are shown in Fig.2e at wavelengths corresponding to the peaks of the ER spectra. With VO2(S), the field profile at 1320\\xa0nm shows the excitation of a longitudinal plasmon mode with a pin-like E-field distribution in the vertical nanopillars of the U shaped nanostructures such that there is a significant E-field coupling between the two vertical nanopillars. On the contrary, the field profile of the U shaped switch with VO2(M) at the 1320\\xa0nm wavelength shows an OFF state as almost negligible field enhancement is observed. In addition, the field profile at 2630\\xa0nm, with VO2(S), shows another longitudinal plasmon mode such that strong E-field coupling occurs between the two vertical nanopillars of adjacent U shaped nanostructures instead of the coupling between the nanopillars of the same U shaped nanostructure. The field profile of the U shaped switch, with VO2(M), at 2630\\xa0nm shows an OFF state. When the incident light is polarized in the Y direction, a longitudinal plasmon mode at ERY(i.e., at 2100\\xa0nm) is excited in the vertical nanopillars such that strong field coupling occurs along the Y direction between the adjacent U shaped nanostructures placed vertically as an array. There is no coupling between the U shaped nanostructures along the X direction for this mode. The E-field profile with VO2(M) at 2100\\xa0nm shows an OFF state of the switch.',\n",

       "  'Additionally, as expected, it can be observed from Fig.2f–j that as the orientation of the U shaped plasmonic switch is changed to a C shaped plasmonic switch, the reflectance spectra as well as the ER spectra get reversed for the X-polarized light and Y-polarized light as compared to that of the U shaped plasmonic switch. Thus, two plasmonic modes are excited at ERY−SW(i.e., at 1320\\xa0nm) and ERY−LW(i.e., at 2630\\xa0nm) for Y-polarized light and one plasmonic mode is excited at ERX(i.e., 2100\\xa0nm) for X-polarized light, when VO2is in its semiconductor state. Hence, neither the U shaped nor the C shaped plasmonic switches alone are truly dual-wavelength due to significantly different ERs being obtained at different wavelengths. Moreover, both these switches are heavily polarization dependent with a very different switching behavior for X- and Y-polarization.',\n",
       "  'Therefore, to realize a polarization-independent plasmonic switch, we have used a hybrid combination of U shaped nanopillars and C shaped nanopillars to form a U-C type plasmonic switch (see Fig.3). In addition, to make these switches truly dual-wavelength, i.e., to obtain similar ER at both wavelengths of switching (ER at short wavelength (ERSW) and ER at long wavelength (ERLW)), we have also carried out an extensive analysis of the spatial offset between the U and C shaped nanostructures. The spatial offset is taken as the distance between the axis passing through the center of U shaped nanostructure (au) and the axis passing through the center of C shaped nanostructure (ac). A comprehensive analysis of the ER spectra of the proposed U-C type plasmonic switches with varying spatial offsets is shown in Fig.3. The length of nanopillars of U and C shaped nanostructures ‘L’, the width of nanopillars ‘W’, the height of nanopillars ‘H’, the gap ‘G’ between adjacent U and C shaped nanostructures, and the thickness of VO2film ‘t’ is taken to be 100\\xa0nm, 20\\xa0nm, 50\\xa0nm, 30\\xa0nm, and 100\\xa0nm, respectively. Figure3a shows the schematic of a unit cell of VO2based U-C type plasmonic switch consisting of periodic U and C shaped gold nanostructures with zero spatial offset, i.e., no offset between auand ac. It can be observed from Fig.3b that there are two dips in the reflectance spectra of the U-C (Offset\\u2009=\\u20090) type plasmonic switch with VO2(S) for both X- and Y-polarized light, which are expressed as the peaks in the ER spectra. However, it can be noted from the ER spectra shown in Fig.3c that the ER is different at the short wavelength (ERSW) and long wavelength (ERLW) for X-polarized (ER of ~\\u20097.5 dB at 1535\\xa0nm and ER of ~\\u200914.5 dB at 2385\\xa0nm) and Y-polarized (ER of ~\\u200915 dB at 1700\\xa0nm and ER of ~\\u200924 dB at 2455\\xa0nm) light.',\n",
       "  'As shown in Fig.3d–f, on introducing a spatial offset which is less than the length of the nanopillars ‘L’ (i.e., 50\\xa0nm offset between auand ac), it can be observed from the ER spectra that an ER of ~\\u200912 dB at 1550\\xa0nm and an ER of ~\\u200921.5 dB at 2250\\xa0nm is obtained with X-polarized light and an ER of ~\\u200918 dB at 1600\\xa0nm and an ER of ~\\u200923 dB at 2190\\xa0nm is obtained with a Y-polarized light. It must be noted that although the switching performance is significantly better in this case, it is still neither truly polarization-independent nor truly dual-wavelength switchable. When the spatial offset is increased beyond the length of the nanopillars ‘L’ (i.e., 150\\xa0nm offset between auand ac) as shown in Fig.3g–i, the switch becomes polarization-independent. For both X- and Y-polarized light, an ER of ~\\u200928 dB at 1565\\xa0nm and an ER of ~\\u200914.5 dB at 2065\\xa0nm is obtained. Although this spatial offset results in polarization-independence, this switch is not truly dual-wavelength due to the different ERs at the two wavelengths of switching. Hence, to make the U-C type plasmonic switch polarization-independent as well as dual-wavelength, the spatial offset between the U and C shaped nanostructures is set equal to the length of the nanopillars ‘L’ (i.e., 100\\xa0nm offset between auand ac) as shown in Fig.3j–l. It can be observed from the ER spectra of the plasmonic switch with a spatial offset equal to length ‘L’ (see Fig.3l) that that the switching performance is almost equal at both the wavelengths—i.e., an ER of ~\\u200920 dB at 1560\\xa0nm and 2130\\xa0nm—for both X- and Y- polarized light. Hence, U-C type plasmonic switches with the spatial offset equal to length ‘L’ have been proposed to realize truly dual-wavelength polarization-independent active switching. In addition, it must be noted that plasmonic switches capable of achieving polarization independence with a high ER of ~\\u200920 dB at two different telecommunication wavelengths of 1560\\xa0nm and 2130\\xa0nm have not been reported so far. Further, it should be noted that 1560\\xa0nm lies in the low loss C-band which is most widely used in optical communication networks such as free space optics (FSO) and dense wavelength division multiplexing (DWDM). Moreover, with the advent of the 2000\\xa0nm waveband technologies such as—edge-couple photodetectors based on InGaAs, thulium-doped fiber amplifiers (TDFA) and laser injection locking, the 2000\\xa0nm waveband has recently been suggested for futuristic optical communications61. Hence, the switches proposed in this paper could potentially be utilized for both the conventional C-band (1530–1565\\xa0nm) and for the futuristic 2000\\xa0nm band as they offer simultaneous high ER at 1560\\xa0nm and at 2130\\xa0nm, with a polarization-independent operation. The switching performance of the proposed U-C type plasmonic switches with variable spatial offsets is also tabulated in Table1. The switching behavior of another polarization-independent design based on four symmetrically rotated U shaped nanopillars is also shown in Supplementary Fig.S4(See Supplementary Information) to highlight the advantage of introducing spatial offset in designing truly dual-wavelength plasmonic switches proposed in this paper. In addition, a comparison of our work with dual-wavelength or polarization-independent VO2based plasmonic switches is given in Table2.',\n",

Figure4a shows the ER spectra for the proposed switch as the polarization angle of incident light ‘ϕ’ is varied from 0° to 90°. It can be observed from Fig.4a that the ER spectra are almost the same at both the short wavelength mode (ERSW) and the long wavelength mode (ERLW) for all the polarization angles, with the maximum ER of ~\\u200920 dB simultaneously at two wavelengths—1560\\xa0nm and 2130\\xa0nm.

It can be observed from Fig.4b that the proposed switch gives almost the same switching performance for all the polarization angles, thus illustrating that the proposed switch is a polarization-independent as well as dual-wavelength plasmonic switch.

At a polarization angle of 0° for the incident light, Fig.4c shows that, at a wavelength of 1560\\xa0nm, with VO2in its semiconductor state (ON state of the switch), ModeSWis excited in the U-C type plasmonic switch which consists of two modes excited in the U and C shaped nanostructures, respectively, with a weak coupling between them. The U shaped nanostructure exhibits a longitudinal mode LM I such that the E-field is localized between the two vertical arms of the U shaped nanostructure while the C shaped nanostructure supports a longitudinal mode LM II with a pin-like distribution of the field on the parallel arms of the C shaped nanostructure. With VO2in its metal state, however, the field enhancement is negligible at this wavelength, and hence the switch is in its OFF state. At a wavelength of 2130\\xa0nm, with VO2(S), ModeLWis excited in the U-C type plasmonic switch which is made up of two longitudinal modes—LM III and LM II (see Fig.4c) —being excited in the U and C shaped nanostructure, respectively, with weak coupling between the two modes. With VO2(M), the switch exhibits negligible field enhancement at 2130\\xa0nm, hence signifying the OFF state of the switch. The charge density profiles for the U-C (Offset\\u2009=\\u2009L) type plasmonic switches are shown in Fig.4d at wavelengths of 1560\\xa0nm and 2130\\xa0nm with the VO2in its semiconductor and metal states, respectively. These charge density profiles clearly show the excitation of mode ModeSW(consisting of mode LM I and mode LM II) at a wavelength of 1560\\xa0nm, and the excitation of mode ModeLW(consisting of mode LM III and mode LM II) at a wavelength of 2130\\xa0nm in these nanostructures, when VO2is in its semiconductor state. It may be noted that the charge density profiles at the wavelengths of maximum ER, i.e., 1560\\xa0nm and 2130\\xa0nm, for the switch when VO2is in its metal state do not correspond to the same modes with VO2(S) because the modes for the switch undergo a significant blue-shift (see Fig.3k) when VO2transforms from semiconductor to a metal.

Further, the wavelengths of maximum ER can also be spectrally tuned by tweaking these geometrical parameters. Figure5b shows the effect of varying the thickness of VO2film on the reflectance spectra of the proposed switches with X-polarized light, for the case when VO2is in its semiconductor state. It can be seen from the inset of Fig.5b that as the thickness of the underlying VO2film ‘t’ is increased from 80\\xa0nm to 120\\xa0nm, there is a significant red-shift in the plasmon resonance wavelength for the ModeSWfrom 1425\\xa0nm to 1680\\xa0nm and for ModeLWfrom 2070\\xa0nm to 2230\\xa0nm. A similar red-shifting of the plasmon resonance wavelength is observed for the case when VO2is in its metal state, as shown in Fig.5c. It is well known that the plasmon resonance wavelength of a plasmonic nanostructure is strongly dependent on the substrate on which the nanostructure is present64. Thus, the effect of thickness of the VO2layer on the plasmonic modes of the U-C shaped nanopillars can be understood by effectively modelling the proposed switch as a U-C shaped nanopillar array placed on top of a substrate with an effective dielectric permittivity ‘\\\\(\\\\:{\\\\epsilon\\\\:}_{eff}\\\\)’. As a thick gold layer is present on top of the SiO2layer, the substrate can be treated equivalent to a layer of VO2on top of a gold substrate. The effective medium constants can then be modelled using an effective medium approximation. For this analysis, the well-known Bruggeman’s effective medium approximation59has been used to model the effective dielectric permittivity of the resulting substrate using the following equations:',\n",
       "  'where\\\\(\\\\:{\\\\epsilon\\\\:}_{{VO}_{2}\\\\left(S\\\\right)}\\\\),\\\\(\\\\:{\\\\epsilon\\\\:}_{{VO}_{2}\\\\left(M\\\\right)}\\\\),\\\\(\\\\:{\\\\epsilon\\\\:}_{Au}\\\\:\\\\)and\\\\(\\\\:{\\\\epsilon\\\\:}_{eff}\\\\)are the wavelength dependent dielectric constants of VO2(S), VO2(M), gold and the modelled effective medium, respectively.

The real and imaginary parts of the modelled effective media have been calculated using the above equation using a mathematical solver for different thicknesses of the VO2layer, for the case when VO2is present in its semiconductor and metallic states, respectively, and are shown in Fig.S3(See Supplementary Information).',\n",
       "  'It can be clearly seen from these figures that, as the thickness of the VO2layer increases, the real part of the effective dielectric permittivity (see Fig.S3a,c) for the underlying substrate increases, for both VO2(M) and VO2(S). It has previously been well demonstrated by Perera et al.65, Xu et al.66, and Malinsky et al.64that an increase in the real part of the dielectric permittivity of the substrate leads to the plasmon resonance condition being met at a higher wavelength of incident light, thus leading to a red-shift of the plasmon resonance wavelength. Hence, an increase in the thickness of the VO2layer leads to red-shifting of the plasmonic ModeSWand ModeLW, for cases when VO2is in its semiconductor or metal state, as shown in Fig.5b, c. The ER spectra as a function of thickness are shown in Fig.5d with X-polarized incident light (See Supplementary Information, Fig.S6a for Y-polarized light). It can be observed from Fig.5d that as the thickness of VO2film is increased from 80\\xa0nm to 120\\xa0nm, the short wavelength mode (ERSW) shows a red shift from 1425\\xa0nm to 1680\\xa0nm and the long wavelength mode (ERLW) shows a red-shift from 2070\\xa0nm to 2230\\xa0nm. Further, it can be observed from the bar graph for the magnitude of ER shown in Fig.5e that t\\u2009=\\u2009100\\xa0nm is the most optimized thickness of VO2film where almost equal switching performance of ~\\u200920 dB can simultaneously be achieved at both the wavelengths. The switching performance of the proposed U-C (Offset\\u2009=\\u2009L) type plasmonic switch can be optimized by choosing the right value for the design parameters such as the gap ‘G’ between the U and C shaped nanostructures. In order to understand the trends observed on varying the values of the thickness of the VO2layer, we have analyzed the effect of gap on the switching performance of the proposed switches for varying values of thickness of the VO2layer. For the proposed switch with VO2(S), Fig.6shows the effect of gap ‘G’ with X-polarized light on the two modes in the short and long wavelength regime, for different values of thickness of the VO2layer. Figure6b shows the effect of gap ‘G’ on the reflectance spectra of the proposed switch with the thickness of the VO2layer being 120\\xa0nm, and for the case when VO2is in its semiconductor state. It can clearly be seen that the behavior of the two modes in Fig.6b can be well explained by the plasmon hybridization theory58,67.It must be noted that for this value of thickness, the gold mirror beneath the VO2(S) spacer has minimal effect on the hybridization of the plasmonic modes. Thus, with smaller values of gap ‘G’, the hybridization of the elementary plasmons of the U and C shaped nanopillars results in the splitting of the dipolar mode into a bonding mode (longer wavelength mode), and an antibonding mode (shorter wavelength mode). As the value of gap between the nanostructures is increased from 10\\xa0nm to 120\\xa0nm, the bonding mode continues to blue-shift, while the antibonding mode continues to red-shift, as expected58,67, till the splitting between the modes almost disappears at a gap of ~\\u2009120\\xa0nm. The plasmon shift (Δλ) versus the gap ‘G’ for both the short and the long wavelength mode for t\\u2009~\\u2009120\\xa0nm is also shown in the inset for Fig.6b. For the same thickness, as the phase of the VO2layer changes to a metal, the effective system changes to an array of U-C nanopillars on a metallic substrate with an effective dielectric permittivity calculated as shown in Eq.3. For this system, the incident light induces a strong coupling between the U and C shaped nanostructures giving rise to a screened bonding dimer (SBD) plasmon resonance in the wavelength range\\u2009~\\u2009800–1000\\xa0nm (see Fig.6c) with a strong dipolar character. In addition, for such metal nanostructure on metal systems60, the presence of the conductive surface (VO2(M) on Au) underneath the U-C nanostructures, induces a net charge transfer between the nanopillars often leading to a charge transfer plasmon mode (CTP) at a higher wavelength. However, due to substrate screening, electric dipole moment of the CTP mode is often screened, making it sub-radiant and hidden within the spectra. For the SBD mode, as expected, an increase in the gap ‘G’ leads to reduction in the dipolar interaction, and hence a blue-shift as shown in Fig.6b. The resultant ER bar graphs at the two switching wavelengths for the various gaps for t being 120\\xa0nm are shown in Fig.6d.

       "  'Interestingly, as the value of the thickness of VO2layer is reduced to 100\\xa0nm, the effects of the underlying gold film beneath the VO2layer begin to disrupt the plasmon hybridization between the nanopillars, for the case when VO2is in its semiconductor state. This has also been discussed previously by Nordlander et al.68in complex systems where nanostructures are placed over a dielectric-spacer-separated metallic films. Figure6e shows that as the gap is increased, the longer wavelength mode blue-shifts as expected. The plasmon shift (Δλ) versus the gap ‘G’ is shown in the inset of Fig.6e. However, the short wavelength mode displays an interesting behavior. As the gap is increased from 10\\xa0nm to 40\\xa0nm, the plasmon resonance wavelength red-shifts, after which it blue-shifts as the gap is increased to 120\\xa0nm. This is most likely due to the interplay of the plasmon hybridization and the interaction of the nanopillar plasmons with their images in the gold layer. For the case when VO2transforms to its metal state, the increase in the gap ‘G’ leads to an expected blue-shift as shown in Fig.6f due to the SBD mode as discussed earlier. The resultant ER bar graphs for the various gaps for t being 100\\xa0nm are shown in Fig.6g. It can be observed from the bar graph shown in Fig.6g that G\\u2009=\\u200930\\xa0nm is the most optimized gap for the proposed switch as almost equal ER of ~\\u200920 dB can be achieved at both the switching wavelengths. However, if desired, an appropriate gap can be chosen to tune the operating wavelength at which high ER is needed. The extended ER spectra for this case are given in Supplementary Fig.S7(See Supplementary Information).',\n",
       "  'The role of the underlying gold mirror in perturbing the plasmon hybridization is confirmed through the reflectance spectra plotted in Fig.6h for various values of gaps when the thickness of the VO2(S) layer is further reduced to 80\\xa0nm. For VO2(S), this reduced thickness implies an increased interaction of the nanopillar plasmons with their images in the underlying gold layer68. Thus, both modes at the short and long wavelength, display dipolar behavior and exhibit a blue-shift in the plasmon resonance wavelength as the gap ‘G’ increases from 10\\xa0nm to 120\\xa0nm as shown in Fig.6h. Further, it can be observed from the insets of Fig.6e, h that as the thickness of the VO2layer is decreased from 100\\xa0nm to 80\\xa0nm, the rate at which the longer wavelength mode blue-shifts with a variation in gap, also reduces. For the case when VO2transforms to its metal state, the increase in the gap ‘G’ leads to an expected blue-shift as shown in Fig.6i. The resultant ER bar graphs for the various gaps for t being 80\\xa0nm are shown in Fig.6j.',\n",
       "  'The switching performance of the proposed U-C type plasmonic switch also depends upon the geometrical parameters of the U and C shaped nanopillars such as the length of the nanopillars ‘L’, the width of the nanopillars ‘W’, and the height of the nanopillars ‘H’. This geometrical dependence of the proposed switch with X-polarized light (See Supplementary Information, Fig.S6c for Y-polarized light) is analyzed in terms of an aspect ratio ‘AR’—which is the ratio of the length ‘L’ of the nanopillars to the width ‘W’ of the nanopillars (see Fig.7). The reflectance spectra of the proposed U-C type plasmonic switch with VO2(S) and VO2(M) for various aspect ratios are shown in Fig.7a, b. Figure7a shows that with a lower aspect ratio ‘AR’ of 3 (i.e., L\\u2009=\\u200960\\xa0nm and W\\u2009=\\u200920\\xa0nm), only one lower order plasmonic mode at a wavelength of 1640\\xa0nm is supported by the switch with VO2(S). However, as the value of ‘L’ is increased, Fig.7a shows the emergence of another peak at a short wavelength (SW) in the reflectance spectra for the switch. This additional peak at a lower wavelength can be attributed to the excitation of additional higher order plasmonic modes in the plasmonic switch with VO2(S) due to an increased length of the nanopillars. It should also be noted that both short and the long wavelength mode exhibit a significant red-shift on increasing the aspect ratio. The red-shift of the plasmon resonance wavelength can be explained by approximating the interaction between the U and C shaped nanopillars to be equivalent to the one between interacting nanorods. According to Ganz theory, higher aspect ratios of interacting nanorods imply the resonance condition getting satisfied at higher values of λ. Further, this model leads to a linear dependence of the plasmon resonance wavelength on the aspect ratio69,70. As can be seen in Fig.7a, the red-shifts observed for both the short and long wavelength mode are found to be linear. Figure7b shows the effect of the aspect ratio on the reflectance spectra of the switch with VO2(M). It is found that the plasmon resonance wavelength corresponding to the SBD mode60remains almost the same as the AR is changed. It can be observed from the ER spectra shown in Fig.7c that as the aspect ratio ‘AR’ is increased from 4 (i.e., L\\u2009=\\u200980\\xa0nm and W\\u2009=\\u200920\\xa0nm) to 7 (i.e., L\\u2009=\\u2009140\\xa0nm and W\\u2009=\\u200920\\xa0nm), the ER at the short wavelength mode (ERSW) increases linearly from ~\\u20099 dB to ~\\u200929 dB with a red-shift in the plasmon resonance wavelength from 1460\\xa0nm to 1790\\xa0nm. In addition, the long wavelength mode (ERLW) also shows a red-shift from 1830\\xa0nm to 2810\\xa0nm as the aspect ratio ‘AR’ is increased from 4 to 7. Further, it can be noted that an aspect ratio of 5 (i.e., L\\u2009=\\u2009100\\xa0nm and W\\u2009=\\u200920\\xa0nm) is the most optimized aspect ratio where almost equal switching performance can simultaneously be achieved at both the wavelengths.

       " 'paper_19.html': ['Carbon-based materials have garnered widespread attention owing to their remarkable physical and chemical properties1. Among all nano-carbons, graphene stands out as the most valuable allotropes2. Graphene’s attractive properties, including its exceptional electrical conductivity derived from π-bonds and π-orbitals, lightweight nature, high theoretical surface area, excellent thermal conductivity, and exceptional mechanical strength, have spurred extensive research investigations and led to its integration into diverse fields such as electronics, environmental science, biosensors, transistors, and photovoltaics2,3. Graphene’s properties arise from its two-dimensional structure, comprised of densely arranged sp2-hybridized carbon atoms in a honeycomb crystal lattice. Numerous methods have been developed to produce graphene, broadly categorized as either top-down methods (e.g., mechanical/chemical exfoliation, or chemical synthesis such as reduction of graphene oxide) or bottom-up processes (e.g., chemical vapor deposition (CVD), epitaxial growth, and pyrolysis) being the most common techniques3. Despite their ability to generate high-quality graphene sheets, these methods often involve multi-step chemical synthesis, high-temperature processing, ultra-high vacuum conditions, reducing agents, or high manufacturing system costs4,5which impede their widespread in commercial applications.',\n",
       "  'In 2014, Lin et al. demonstrated the formation of graphene in ambient conditions through direct laser scribing of commercial polyimide (PI) using a carbon dioxide infrared laser6. This breakthrough has sparked a cascade of research exploring various commercial and natural polymers as carbon precursors to generate laser-induced graphene (LIG)7,8,9. The gained popularity of this technique stems from its relative simplicity10and the enhanced properties of LIG, such as higher specific surface area11, as compared to graphene generated through conventional methods. Furthermore, doping graphene with heteroatoms (i.e. Nitrogen, Boron) achieves better electrochemical properties and wettability features12, as these heteroatoms provide active sites for enhanced interactions with guest atoms/molecules. The various methods employed for N-doping, such as chemical vapor deposition or hydrazine (N2H4) treatment13, necessitate high energy consumption and harsh processing conditions. However, LIG can exhibit self-N-doping which originates from the nitrogen groups within the polymer framework, where the residual nitrogen atoms (post-bond cleavage) reassemble with graphene carbon to form several types of N (pyridinic N, graphitic N, and/ or pyrrolic N)12. The percentage of N dopant in LIG varies depending on the chemical structure of the polymer and laser parameters, where changes in the deposited energy on the surface determine the outcomes of the ablation process12.',\n",
       "  'The success of LIG hinges significantly on laser parameters such as wavelength, scanning speed and scan number, pulse duration, and fluence, which directly influence the quality of graphene14. The precise ablation mechanism - whether photothermal (carbonization of the material due to thermal energy deposition, followed by graphitization and exfoliation14) or photochemical (covalent bonds cleavage due photons energy absorption), or combination of both—is still debated15. For PI, one of the most applied sources for LIG, both mechanisms have been observed with the presence of chromophore moieties, such as aromatic rings, C=O, C=N, C=C, and ester groups, within the polymer. These structural features enhance light absorption in the UV-Vis and NIR ranges through electronic transitions or multiphoton absorption, facilitating efficient photoablation16.',\n",
       "  'Embarking on this notion, we have recently reported the development of a LIG-based chemiresistors sensor for volatile organic compounds (VOCs), namely acetone and ethanol, using PI as graphene source, which was later decorated with silver and titanium oxide particles to enhance the electrical conductivity17. On the other hand, we have also reported the development of porous organic polymers (POPs) that have a lightweight composition (primarily comprising C, N, O, and H), and rich with functional groups (π-systems, C=O, C=N, C=C, etc…), as well as aromatic rings and chromophores for environmental applications18,19,20,21,22,23,24. These structural features of POPs, alongside the ease of their synthesis from low-cost raw materials, their high surface area, tunable pore size, and green nature18,25render them ideal carbon sources to produce self-heteroatom-doped LIG. To date, only a few studies have investigated direct laser irradiation of porous metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), resulting generally in a core-shell structure where amorphous or graphitized carbon encases the metal of the MOFs26,27,28. To the best of our knowledge, the use of POPs for LIG production has not been previously reported.',\n",
       "  'Building upon these principles, a novel porous organic polymer, incorporating polynuclear aromatic moieties and triazine groups, was designed and synthesized in this study. The successful synthesis of the naphthalene-based polyimide (denoted as NI-POP) was confirmed with a set of techniques. NI-POP powder was later compressed into a pellet and subjected to femtosecond laser direct writing. Notably, bulk solids and compressed pellet targets require distinct laser parameters due to their contrasting thermal properties. Unlike bulk solids, pressed pellets—particularly low-thermal-conductivity polymers—demand precise control of laser pulses to balance energy deposition and avoid overheating29. Therefore, in contrast to conventional CO₂ lasers, known for causing uncontrolled heat accumulation, femtosecond laser ablation offers key advantages for pellet targets, such as high precision due to ultrashort pulse duration, high energy density per pulse and minimal heat affected zone. These features minimize thermal diffusion and damage, enabling precise material removal and micro-structuring30.',\n",

More importantly, the generated graphene is directly and robustly bonded to the substrate, eliminating the need for additional binders, adhesives, or coating processes typically employed in conventional composite material fabrication. This direct integration not only simplifies the synthesis process but also ensures strong interfacial adhesion, resulting in enhanced mechanical stability of the resulting composite.',\n",
       "  'Consequently, as a proof-of-concept application that leverages the synergistic properties of both components, simultaneous sensing and capture of VOCs by the resulting hybrid material was demonstrated.

Our study represents the first demonstration of dual functionality, as a chemiresistive sensor and adsorbent of VOCs (acetone and ethanol), enabled by the moderate surface area and microporous nature of the intact NI-POP substrate coupled with the conductivity of LIG and the abundance of N species in the composite.

To ensure consistency in the quality of the produced LIG, each case was repeated three times under the identical laser parameters, and the resulting graphene was characterized using Raman spectroscopy.

These results indicate that among the tested speeds, 13\\xa0mm/s is optimal for producing less disordered graphene sheets, regardless of the number of scans. The higher ID/IGintensity observed at 10\\xa0mm/s may be attributed to increased heat accumulation, resulting from longer contact time with the polymer, which introduces more structural defects and vacancies in the graphene network. In contrast, the I2D/IGratio (Fig.S3B) shows an increasing trend from a speed of 15 to 13\\xa0mm/s, indicating the formation of graphene sheets of higher quality. The highest quality sheets were achieved at a speed of 13\\xa0mm/s with 4 scans. Beyond this point, the quality of graphene sheets declines, as evidenced by lower I2D/IGratios.

According to Hwangbo et al. findings43, a ratio of 0.78 corresponds to 3–4 layers of graphene, whereas a ratio of 0.58 implies the stacking of approximately 7 layers. These estimations were further supported by Gaussian Fitting of the 2D peak (Fig.S4). As full width at half maxima (FWHM) of 30\\xa0cm−\\u20091corresponds to having a monolayer graphene sheet, a broadness of 2D peak reflects the existence of a few stacked layers44,45.

After laser irradiation, the relative intensities of C=C increased and became more dominant, while the C=N and imide peaks notably decreased, implying a successful graphitization of NI-POP induced by laser pyrolysis55. However, two additional sub-peaks emerged corresponding to C-N/C-O50at 285.9\\xa0eV and 286\\xa0eV for LIG@NI-POP (4) and LIG@NI-POP (6), respectively, and to carboxylic carbon54at 288.2\\xa0eV and 288.4\\xa0eV for LIG@NI-POP (4) and LIG@NI-POP (6), respectively. These results suggest the successful incorporation of nitrogen and oxygen atoms in various bonding configurations within the graphene structure during the carbonization process12. It is noteworthy that the higher carbon content observed in LIG@NI-POP (6) aligns with our expectations. The increased number of scans delivered more energy, leading to greater bond breakage and the release of more heteroatoms as gases. Consequently, this process resulted in a higher carbon content in the final product56. Figure3b shows the N 1s spectrum for NI-POP before and after laser treatment. The doublet pattern of the N 1s peak in NI-POP with equal intensities, confirms the presence of two nitrogen sites with two different chemical environments: one is pyridinic-N (N6) at 398.6\\xa0eV, originating from nitrogen atoms in 6-member rings of triazine groups, and the other is single bonded nitrogen at 399.8\\xa0eV, called pyrrolic-N (N5), originating from nitrogen atoms in 5-member rings of imide groups57. Following the laser structuring, the distribution of nitrogen types changed with respect to the number of scans applied (Fig.3b). The deconvolution spectrum after 4 scans can be well-fitted into only two peaks, where the percentage of pyrrolic N increased by 6% compared to the pristine polymer. On the other hand, three peaks were observed when NI-POP was irradiated with 6 scans: 399.1, 400.0, and 403.2, corresponding to N6, N5, and N–O, respectively58,59. The pyridinic N relative % went significantly down to 29%, while the pyrrolic N% went up to 69%, with the emergence of a minor peak corresponding to oxidized N. Given that the laser irradiation occurred in ambient air, the presence of a small percentage of oxidized N was expected60. This explains the appearance of the subpeak of N–O at higher energy input as more O and N are released.',\n",

As NI-POP contained exclusively carbonyl of imide, only one peak was observed at 532.3\\xa0eV for pristine polymer, which corresponds to O=C–N. It is believed that during laser exposure in ambient air, the broken imide groups were partially replaced by carboxylic groups at the edges of the graphene network. This is reflected in the deconvolution of the O 1s spectra of the processed polymer into two peaks: the C=O peak decreased relatively, and an additional peak appeared at 534.3\\xa0eV and 533.9\\xa0eV after 4 and 6 scans, respectively, corresponding to the C–O bond of O–C=O. The elemental composition of the laser-processed samples is consistent with the high ID/IGratio observed in Raman data for both cases (Fig.S3A), which suggests defects in the graphene structure. These defects are specifically due to the incorporation of nitrogen and oxygen atoms into the graphene sheets during the ablation process. In summary, compared to pristine NI-POP, the LIG@NI-POP exhibited an increase in C–C bond content and a decrease in O=C–N/C=N bonds. Due to the excessive thermal energy imparted by the laser, photons’ absorption by NI-POP caused polymer degradation, surpassing the dissociation energy of O=C–N and C=N bonds originating from imide and triazine moieties in the polymer. This bond cleavage was followed by atom rearrangement to form doped graphene sheets39. The significant nitrogen content (~\\u200916% and ~\\u200912% after 4 and 6 scans, respectively) is primarily attributed to the abundant nitrogen moieties, such as triazine and imide groups, present in the initial building blocks. Despite the breaking of C=N/C–N bonds due to the photochemical or thermal absorption of the laser beam, the substantial post-processing nitrogen percentage suggests that the released nitrogen atoms were effectively re-incorporated into the graphene structure. Moreover, the observed decrease in the nitrogen atomic percentage at higher scan numbers can be explained by a greater release of nitrogen atoms from the material’s surface under higher energy deposition61.',\n",

The BET surface areas of these materials and their pore size distributions (PSD) are summarized in TableS1. The surface area of the pristine NI-POP decreased by about 64% after compressing the powder into a pellet (Fig.5A). Such decrease has been observed with porous materials when subjected to a mechanical pressure63. Because of the significant reduction of the internal free volume upon the mechanical compression, a slight shift in the dominant pore size from 12.3 to 10.9 Å was observed (Fig.5B), accompanied with a decrease in the pore volume, while maintaining overall a similar PSD profile before and after formation of pellets. This down-shift in pore size can be explained by enhanced alignment and stacking of the aromatic rings of the polymer upon compression. Meanwhile, compared to the untreated pellet, LIG@NI-POP pellets exhibited no significant change in their BET surface area or PSD, irrespective of the number of scans (Fig.5A,B). This suggests that the bulk porosity properties of the material are largely unaffected by the surface modification. It is assumed that only a small volume of the pores existing in the surface layers was affected upon carbonization. This was supported by an SEM cross-sectional image of LIG@NI-POP (4) which demonstrated the conversion of a few surface layers into graphene, while the integrity of the bulk polymer remained intact (Fig.S7). As supported by the SEM images (Fig.4A,B) and BET findings, the produced graphene is of a mesoporous nature, which might have compensated for the ablated surface area sites, resulting in almost unchanged BET surface area after laser processing.',\n",

As mentioned above, the substrate was subjected to continuous flow for 7\\xa0min, followed by a 3-minute rest period to observe the behavior of the sensor after the flow had stopped. The sensitivity of the sensor was then analyzed by calculating the percentage change in gas response defined as S% (Eq.\\xa01). The response to both VOCs differed from conventional sensor that typically shows a resistance change that returns to its initial value after the flow stops17,65,66. Compared to literature, this study shows a distinct behavior characterized by a continuous increase in resistance during VOC exposure, followed by saturation once the gas flow ceased, with no recovery noted. This behavior is attributed to the unique properties of the composite, suggesting its suitability for both sensing and vapor storage applications. Comparatively, for the same concentration and exposure time, LIG@NI-POP (4) showed a significantly higher change in resistance when exposed to acetone vapor than ethanol (Fig.6A,B). The sensitivity to acetone reached approximately 17% after 7\\xa0min of exposure and eventually stabilized at around 18.5% after 3\\xa0min of stopping the flow, with no observed decline or recovery during the rest period. The observed increase after pausing the vapor flow can be attributed to residual vapor within the chamber migrating towards the substrate. The resistance change reached a steady maximum, indicating maximum vapor capture at the tested concentration. This sensitivity was significantly higher than those observed for ethanol, which only reached about 3.5% within the same timeframe. This difference in sensitivity implies stronger interactions, quicker adsorption kinetics, and higher diffusion rates of acetone vapor into the composite structure relative to ethanol. Additionally, the repeatability test (Fig.6C,D)showed an immediate increase in resistance upon exposure to acetone, followed by a plateau-like phase during rest, and a gradual increment with each subsequent injection. In contrast, a spike-like behavior was observed with ethanol vapor, with more pronounced recovery observed after the supply ceased.

The predominant pore size of LIG@NI-POP (4) is around 11 Å, making it effective for capturing both acetone and ethanol, which have kinetic diameters of 4.6 and 4.5 Å, respectively68. It is believed that the hierarchy of pores played a vital role in the capture process since micropores (<\\u20092\\xa0nm) act as effective adsorption sites for VOCs, providing significant capacity for VOC storage, while mesopores enhance their diffusion within the structure67.',\n",
       "  'The observed selectivity to acetone, despite similar kinetic diameters, can be attributed to stronger interactions with the adsorbent. Ethanol is likely to form hydrogen bonds69with the imide groups of non-irradiated areas of NI-POP and the nitrogen species in the graphene network. Acetone, while forming weaker hydrogen bonds with its carbonyl group, benefits from additional interactions. First, π-π interactions can exist between the carbonyl π-bond and the rich π-system of NI-POP and doped graphene. Second, nitrogen doping can increase the polarity of the adsorbent and enhance the interactions between the adsorbates and the adsorbent surface52and hence facilitates a Lewis acid-base interaction, in which the carbonyl group acts as an electron acceptor and the nitrogen entities serve as electron donors. These synergistic interactions, combined with the suitable pore size and abundant nitrogen species in the composite, promote multilayer adsorption of acetone52, accelerating the vapor diffusion into the matrix.',\n",
       "  'With respect to the sensing mechanism, the typical detection process for VOCs in conducting systems involves the absorption and swelling of materials. In addition to adsorption, the diffusion of analytes into the conducting N-doped graphene system often leads to a swelling process70. As acetone or ethanol molecules diffuse into the network, the interlayer distance of stacked graphene increases due to swelling, making electron hopping more difficult70,71,72. Such an increase ind-spacing between graphene layers leads to a significant increase in resistance upon exposure to VOCs. Given acetone’s stronger adsorption onto N-doped graphene due to reinforced interactions, its diffusion causes more prominent layer separation. This, in turn, disrupts electron hopping within the π-cloud, greatly increasing the sensor’s sensitivity.',\n",

Comprehensive characterization techniques confirmed the successful formation of a hierarchical porous composite, LIG@NI-POP, comprising self- N and O co-doped LIG integrated onto non-irradiated NI-POP. The doping process occurred without the need for additional steps or chemicals to incorporate nitrogen atoms. Optimizing the laser parameters resulted in achieving few-layered LIG with a relatively high I2D/IGratio (0.78) under irradiation with a femtosecond laser operating at 1.5\\xa0W power, 13\\xa0mm/s scanning speed, and 4 scans, designated as LIG@NI-POP (4). The unique properties of LIG@NI-POP (4) made it suitable for dual functionality: real-time detection and capture of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) with high sensitivity and selectivity to acetone, leveraging the synergistic effects of graphene’s conductivity and NI-POP microporous structure. Importantly, our approach expands the application of laser treatment to laboratory-scale polymers, eliminating the requirement for them to be strictly thermoset, and thermoplastic to withstand laser energy. This flexibility allows exploring a wide range of porous organic polymers as potential carbon precursors for graphene production, owing to the abundance of chromophores within this material class, which enables efficient photoablation. Also, our methodology opens new avenues for fabricating and customizing composites consisting of heteroatom self-doped graphene tightly bound to polymer base, tailored to specific applications, particularly those requiring microporosity and conductivity, ranging from sensors to energy storage devices.',\n",

Due to their similar atomic arrangements, a series of transition metal carbides, nitrides, and carbonitrides are categorized as MAX series materials (MAXs), once named H-phases in 1960s [1]. Up to now, over 383 different types of MAXs have been reported based on synthetic strategy innovation on solid-state reaction sintering, melting reaction, and physicochemical deposition. Meanwhile, a series of novel MAXs are predicted by theoretical simulation and machine learning. The diversity investigations in elemental composition and structure bring the adjustable properties: ceramic characteristics (high-temperature resilience [2], strength [3], and oxidation resistance [4]); metallic properties (conductivity [5], thermal conduction [6], machinability [7], and impact durability [8]). MAXs are intended in the potential function requirements in rail transportation lubrication [9], heating components [10], electrical contacts [11,12], electromagnetic shielding [13], microwave absorption [14], high-level radioactive waste solidification [15], and electrochemical energy storage [16,17]. MXene series materials, as the low-dimensional derivatives, showed potential applications in electrochemical energy storage [18], luminescence [19], catalysis, and other fields [20,21]. Figure1shows the high-frequency keywords of MAX’s research. However, MAXs are not a material cornerstone to future industrialization prospects.

       "  \"Multi-element occupations at the M, A or X sites create the solid solution MAXs in Table1. Due to the mutual modulation between various elements, these atoms show two kinds of arrangement states: disordered and ordered. An ordered arrangement is that each M′ and M′′ atom occupies, respectively, a separate atomic layer and shows the out-of-plane ordered structure. Within a single atomic layer, there is only one type of M atom. M′ atomic layers envelop one or two layers of M′′ atomic layers (as shown in Fig.5a). This type of ordered solution of MAXs is marked as o-MAXs and remains hexagonal (P63/mmc) [164]. The ideal o-MAXs of 312\\xa0M'2M''AX2and 413\\xa0M'2M''2AX3present a relatively accurate proportion of M'/M'' [208]. Recently, the third metal element was introduced as doping atoms in M'/M''-site in disordered form [166]. A series of correlations were discovered, (i) M' near the A atomic layer does not form the corresponding binary rock salt MC structure, (ii) M' and M'' atomic sizes are similar, and (iii) the electronegativity between M' and A is different [209,210]. The other ordered arrangement is that M′ and M′′ atoms appear in the same atomic layer and exhibit the in-plane ordered structure (i-MAX) [35]. It is worth noting that i-MAX showcases a blend of monoclinic (C2/m and C2/c) and orthorhombic (Cmcm) crystal structures (as shown in Fig.5b). The deviation from hexagonal symmetry in the i-MAX structure arises from the atomic size difference between the two metals being greater than 0.2\\xa0Å (rM'\\u2009<\\u2009rM''), which causes the M' and M'' atoms to no longer occupy the same planes. The M'' atoms move closer to the A-layer, influencing the structure of the A-layer and causing it to deviate from a hexagonal lattice toward a Kagomé-like lattice. However, the three types of i-MAX structures still maintain the same Al-M'4/3M''2/3-Al subunit, with only the stacking arrangement along the c-axis differing [122]. The solid solution orderly structure of i-MAXs is significantly influenced by the mass and atomic radii of their constituent elements. The i-MAX enriched with lighter elements like Ce and Pr tends to adopt the C2/m structure, while those with heavier elements such as Tb, Nd, Gd, Dy, Ho, Er, and Tm favor the C2/c structure [42]. It is driven by atomic radius differences, particularly among M elements with larger radii. The varying distances of M elements to A elements and the structural configurations of M′ and M′′ elements are key factors in this differentiation [43,52].\",\n",

       "  \"Despite the growing variety of methods to prepare MAXs, the process encounters several hurdles. Primarily, the synthesis of MAXs requires high-temperature and high-pressure environments, posing a challenge for scaling up and industrial production. Synthesis often occurs at temperatures ranging from 1000 to 1700\\xa0°C and pressures from 1 to 50\\xa0MPa, necessitating special equipment and techniques that increase costs and risks. Frequently, the synthesis results in incomplete reactions, leading to products with impurities and defects that compromise their purity and functional properties. For instance, excessive reactions between the M element with A or X elements can result in unwanted MA or MX phases, or internal diffusion of the A element can disrupt the A-layer structure, diminishing the electrical and thermal conductivity and the oxidation resistance of MAXs. Moreover, controlling MAXs' geometrical morphology and crystal structure is challenging, limiting their utility. Typically as powders or bulks, it is challenging to fabricate MAXs into coatings, films, or fibers. Their layered structure complicates the creation of heterogeneous or composite configurations, thus limiting their potential applications across various application scenarios.\",\n",

       "  \"In 2016, Wang et al. [230] employed density functional theory-based first-principles calculations to thoroughly investigate the lattice structure, stability, electronic structure, and mechanical and thermal properties of Ti3(SnxAl1−x)C2solid solutions across varying Sn concentrations. Their research indicates that increasing Sn content minimally impacts the crystal structure, and these solid solutions behave as metallic, stable, and brittle materials both thermodynamically and mechanically. Notably, the maximum bulk modulus was observed at the Sn doping concentration of 0.75, and the maximum shear modulus was observed at the Sn doping concentration of 0.5. Moreover, these solid solutions boast high melting points and Debye temperatures, with their lattice thermal conductivity at room temperature exceeding 40 W m−1K−1for x values of 0, 0.25, and 0.5, indicating superior thermal conductivity. In 2021, Ahams et al. [231] first applied DFT to analyze the structure, elasticity, and electronic properties of novel MAXs such as (V0.25Zr0.75)2PbC, (V0.5Zr0.5)2PbC, (V0.75Zr0.25)2PbC, and V2PbC and studied the effects of changes in V and Zr concentrations on the properties of Zr2PbC. Their research revealed that the structural integrity of these new MAXs remains stable within the P63/mmc space group as the V element ratio increases, with the 25% V-containing samples showing improved plasticity, compressibility, brittleness, and hardness. Elastic constants rose with higher V concentrations, and the atomic concentration also influenced the MAXs' electronic band structure and total density of states (TDOS), offering crucial insights for predicting and understanding the performance of MAXs. In 2022, Zeng et al. [232] employed density functional theory (DFT) to explore the Nb2AN (A=\\u2009Si, Ge, Sn) MAXs compounds, focusing on their structure, mechanical attributes, electronic structure, and thermal behavior. The study revealed that these compounds not only maintain strong structures but also maintain dynamic mechanical stability. Notably, the Nb2SnN phase stood out for its superior thermal shock resistance, even though it didn't have the highest melting point among the group. Due to its thermal expansion coefficient in the temperature range of 300–1452 K being very close to that of nickel-based alloys, coupled with the lowest lattice thermal conductivity, it has become a promising candidate for thermal barrier coating (TBC) applications. The Nb2SnN phase is distinguished by its mechanical resilience, attributed to the minimal deformation of its octahedral structure, high ductility, and low anisotropy. Electronic analyses pinpointed the phase's low Debye temperature Θ to its high ionic character and minimal covalency. Further extending the scope, in 2024, Tian et al. [233] delved into the impact of pressure on V2ZnC's crystal structure, elasticity, electronic framework, and thermodynamic steadiness through DFT investigations. They discovered that V2ZnC transitions from brittleness to ductility at a pressure of 20 GPa, with its elastic constants and modulus escalating in response to increased pressure.\",\n",

       "  'MAXs demonstrate mechanical properties, thermal properties, electrical properties, magnetism, high-temperature oxidation resistance, and corrosion resistance, owing to their layered structure consisting of alternating M-X layers bonded by strong covalent bonds and M-A layers bonded by weak metal bonds, endowing them with high hardness, strength, toughness, and excellent electrical and thermal conductivity. This structure enables the material to maintain good mechanical and chemical stability even at high temperatures. For specific application fields, the performance of MAXs can be further adjusted and optimized through methods such as alloying, nanomaterialization, and surface modification.',\n",
       "  'MAXs exhibit a unique combination of mechanical advantages, including high strength, moderate hardness (4–6 GPa), excellent fracture toughness (3–5\\xa0MPa m1/2), superior wear resistance, and exceptional thermal shock resistance. These performances can be maintained even at high temperatures due to the stable layered crystal structure. The mechanical properties stem from the hybrid bonding, with strong covalent M-X bonds contributing to hardness and high-temperature stability, and metallic M-A bonds providing ductility. The layered structure also allows for self-lubrication and crack resistance, ensuring enhanced durability. This unique interplay of ceramic-like and metallic features gives MAXs a significant edge in demanding applications like aerospace, automotive, and energy systems. Table2summarizes the mechanical properties.',\n",
       "  \"Typically, MAXs have a brittle-plastic transition temperature (BPTT), which is the transition temperature from typical brittle fracture (traditional ceramics) to fracture toughness (metals). When the environment temperature is higher than BPTT, the bending strength rapidly decreases. As the temperature increases, the Young's modulus of MAXs decreases, but the high stiffness remains [66]. Thermal stability is also an important criterion. MAXs can sustain the structure integrity, and the strength increases upon quenching in the air at 1300 °C. In addition, larger grain sizes can achieve higher thermal stability [244]. Attributed to the microplastic behavior and quasi-metallic damage tolerance (KBs) during quenching, MAXs can maintain excellent mechanical properties and thermal stability even in high-temperature environments.\",\n",
       "  'MAXs are good thermal conductors, with thermal conductivities ranging from 12 to 60 W m−1K−1at RT. The total thermal conductivity (κth) is determined by both the electronic thermal conductivity (κe) and the phonon thermal conductivity (κph). In general, for non-S- or Al-containing MAXs, the phonon thermal conductivity (κph) is lower than the electronic thermal conductivity (κe). However, MAX containing S and Al is good phonon conductors; the κphvalue of Ti3AlCN at RT is up to 36 W m−1K−1, the highest value in MAXs [245]. MAX \\' κphis related to their defect concentration, which can be evaluated by the residual resistance ratio (RRR). As the RRR value increases, the κphvalue increases [246]. However, the point defects and the rattler effect suppress the contribution of κphto the thermal conductivity in part of MAXs, which refers to the vibration atoms at their equilibrium positions leading to phonon scattering. Many elements, with atomic numbers\\u2009>\\u2009S, tend to \"rattle,\" which explains why the phonon thermal conductivity of Ti2InC, Hf2InC, Nb2SnC, and other compounds contributes less to the overall thermal conductivity.',\n",
       "  'The heat capacity of MAXs depends on the following factors: temperature, chemical composition, crystal structure, and potential phase transitions. At low temperatures, the heat capacity increases nonlinearly, governed by the Debye model, while at high temperatures it approaches the classical limit (~\\u20093R per atom). At high temperatures, it tends to be constant, approaching the Dulong Petit limit. Variations in M, A, and X significantly influence phonon spectra and thus heat capacity. The layered structure results in unique lattice vibrations, with defects and doping further modifying thermal properties. Despite metallic behavior, MAXs exhibit low electronic contributions to heat capacity, with phonons being dominant. These properties, combined with high thermal conductivity and stability, make MAXs suitable for high-temperature applications such as thermal management, energy storage, aerospace, and nuclear systems [7,8].',\n",
       "  'The coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) describes the variation in volume with temperature. A low CTE can reduce internal stress caused by thermal expansion and contraction, thereby improving the thermal cycling stability and service life. The thermal expansion behavior is anisotropic due to the relatively weak interlayer bonds (MA or van der Waals forces) and relatively strong intra-layer bonds (MX). This unique bonding characteristic limits the thermal expansion of the lattice, allowing MAX to maintain stable volume in high-temperature environments and reduce the damage of thermal stress to the structure [8].',\n",
       "  'MAXs exhibit metallic conductivity because: (1) The high density of electronic states near the Fermi level provides a large number of conductive electrons. (2) The unique layered structure of MAX, alternating M-X layers and A layers, facilitates the free electron migration within the M-X layers, while reducing scattering and thereby enhancing conductivity. (3) The weak interlayer interactions result in lower electron scattering rates, thereby maintaining higher electron mobility. Meanwhile, the scattering effects of impurities, vacancies, or other defects may lead to a higher residual resistivity and a lower RRR at low temperatures. The solid solution MAXs show a higher resistivity than the corresponding MAXs due to the stronger scattering effect, leading to a decrease in electron mobility. Since N(EF) predominates in the d-orbitals of the solid solution elements, the impact of substitutions at different positions (M, A, X) on resistivity is not equal [247]. In addition, the morphology of MAX also affects resistivity, mainly due to different surface areas of MAX with different appearances, with a larger specific surface area providing more surface area. During the contact process between electrons and external electrodes or other materials, it increases the contact points for electron transmission and improves conductivity efficiency [248].',\n",
       "  'Owing to the strong covalent and ionic bonding interactions, coupled with weaker metallic or van der Waals interactions, this structural characteristic enables electrons to maintain long-range coherence at low temperatures, facilitating the formation of Cooper pairs, thereby promoting the frictionless flow of superconducting current, which is one of the fundamental principles of superconductivity. MAXs exhibit a higher density of electronic states near the Fermi level, which enhances electron–phonon coupling. The d-electron states of elements such as Ti, Mo, and Nb significantly contribute to superconductivity, such as the superconductivity of Mo2GaC [249] and Nb2SnC [250] which has been demonstrated. The introduction of C or N atoms provides additional electronic states, which promotes the formation of stable electron–phonon coupling systems, thereby improving superconductivity. Experiments have found that certain MAXs exhibit a superconducting transition within a specific low-temperature range, similar to the behavior of traditional superconductors. For instance, the superconducting transition temperature for Mo2GaC is 3.7–4.1\\xa0K [249], while Nb2SC is below 5\\xa0K [250]. In addition, Nb2SnC, at 7.8\\xa0K, exhibits a higher superconducting transition temperature [250].',\n",
       "  'By introducing a magnetic element component into M- or A-site, MAXs can realize magnetic properties. Cr2GeC is antiferromagnetic [251]; (Cr1−xMnx)2GeC formed by partially replacing Cr with Mn induces ferromagnetic polarization. The average magnetic moment and Curie temperature increase with the increase in Mn doping content. The magnetic properties of (Cr1−xMnx)2GeC depend on the concentration of Mn and the atomic configuration of Cr and Mn in the crystal lattice [252]. The competition outcome between ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic states depends on the local chemical composition and the ordered state of the M sites, including (Cr,Mn)2AlC [253], (Cr,Mn)2GeC [252], (Cr,Mn)2GaC [113,114], (Mo,Mn)2GaC [115], (V,Mn)3GaC2[162], Cr2AlC [67], Cr2GeC [239], and Mn2GaC [80]. (Mo2/3RE1/3)2AlC, a series of the magnetic i-MAXs, with RE standing for Ce, Pr, Nd, Sm, Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, Er, Tm, and Lu, exhibit a special microstructure of quasi-two-dimensional magnetically frustrated triangular lattice layers covering the Mo honeycomb structure [42]. The introduction of A-site elements also provides a new pathway for the modulation of magnetic properties [38]. Fe, Ni, Co, and Mn with 3delectrons have been generally added into the A-site. V2(AxSn1−x)C exhibits hysteresis lines with an \"S\" shape at low temperatures, and the saturation magnetization intensity gradually decreases with increasing temperature, which indicates that it is a typical soft magnetic material. This strong magnetic modulation that relies on element combinations can precisely control the magnetism of MAXs.',\n",
       "  \"The oxidation resistance of MAX at high temperatures primarily stems from the diffusion behavior of their specific metal elements, especially those containing Al elements. At high temperatures, the Al atoms tend to diffuse to the surface, forming a dense Al2O3protective layer that effectively prevents oxygen penetration (as shown in Fig.8a) [254]. However, the grain size of MAXs significantly affects the diffusion rate of the Al element. For Ti2AlC with small grain size, Al atoms can quickly diffuse to the surface of the grain and uniformly form an Al2O3protective layer. On the contrary, for Ti2AlC with large grain sizes, Al atoms are difficult to precipitate inside the grain and form a continuous Al2O3protective layer, resulting in weaker oxidation resistance. Additionally, when large grain Ti2AlC precipitates Al at high temperatures, the matrix does not directly transform into TiC, but instead forms a sandwich structure of Ti3AlC2and TiC. This transformation is accompanied by volume contraction, leading to surface cracks that facilitate oxygen infiltration, thus significantly reducing oxidation resistance [255]. Replacing Al with low melting point elements (such as Sn) can lower the temperature of crack healing caused by oxidation, as the oxidation reaction temperature of Sn is lower than that of Al. Specifically, SnO2can form at 460\\xa0°C, whereas Al2O3requires 900\\xa0°C. The high diffusivity and fluidity of Sn facilitate crack repair through oxidation reactions [256]. Nevertheless, these properties can also lead to the diffusion of Sn to the sample surface, promoting the growth of unprotected SnO2. Moreover, the small Al/Ti atom's ratio promotes the growth of a non-protective rutile-TiO2scale (as illustrated in Fig.8b), which in turn affects the alloy's oxidation resistance [254].\",\n",

       "  'Surface roughness also has a significant impact on oxidation resistance. A rough surface increases stress concentration points, making the Al2O3protective layer more susceptible to thermal stress during the initial stages of oxidation, resulting in uneven distribution of stress and the phenomenon of rumpling. Wrinkles can exacerbate the accumulation of compressive stress, causing unstable deformation of the oxide layer in these high stress areas, gradually forming a bubble structure. The irregular morphology of the rough surface makes these bubble structures more likely to form. When bubbles burst under external stress or mechanical disturbance, the exposed matrix in the rough area becomes a pathway for oxygen, accelerating the infiltration of oxygen and leading to the formation of a porous mixed oxide layer (as shown in Fig.8c) [257].',\n",
       "  'The A element can form a stable oxide or nitride protective layer in the corrosive environment, such as aluminum forming an alumina layer and silicon forming a silica layer, which effectively isolates the corrosive medium. In addition, MAXs have a high melting point and excellent thermal stability allowing them to maintain their structural integrity at high temperatures and are not susceptible to thermal decomposition or phase transformation. However, corrosion remains a key factor limiting their long-term use and reliability. In acidic and alkaline environments, MAXs show ceramic material properties with good corrosion resistance, which is mainly related to the elemental composition, whether the M/A element reacts chemically with acid and alkali, and in addition, whether the surface passivation layer can be formed quickly or not, which also determines the corrosion resistance of MAXs in acidic and alkaline environments. It was shown that Ti3SiC2is very stable in NaOH, HCl, and H2SO4concentrated/dilute solutions with negligible mass loss (<\\u20092\\\\(\\\\mu\\\\text{m}\\\\)yr−1) over six months. The corrosion rates in dilute HF and concentrated HNO3were 5 and 13\\xa0mm/yr, respectively. However, in the dilute HNO3solution, the corrosion rate was as high as 250–320\\xa0mm yr−1, which was mainly due to the dissolution of Ti elements into the corrosive medium, leaving behind a Si-rich layer that was oxidized to SiO2in HNO3[258]. Cyclic polarization and chrono-current tests in HCl and H2SO4dilute solutions showed that an irreversible electrically insulating layer was generated on the surface of Ti3SiC2, and this protective film may be responsible for its corrosion resistance. Due to the complex Lewis acid reaction at high temperatures, dissolved A-site elements diffuse into the atomic layer toward the inward molten salt and fluoride salt, resulting in poor corrosion resistance of MAXs in molten salt and fluoride salt environments [259].',\n",

Due to its layered structure, the large theoretical capacity of A-site atoms, and good conductivity, it was once highly anticipated as an anode material [262]. Still, its performance did not meet expectations. Recent studies have revealed that the layered structure advantage of micron-sized (or larger) MAX particles, coupled with the inability of A-site elements with high specific capacity to function, significantly reduces electrochemical performance. According to theoretical calculations and experimental results, reducing particle size can effectively harness the advantages of the MAX and enhance its energy storage performance [263,264]. Compared to traditional electrochemical electrode materials, MAX particles exhibit a higher density and stable lattice valence bond relationships, which makes it challenging for electrolyte ions to migrate and transform the valence bonds of MAXs under potential fields. Additionally, MAX particles are predominantly prepared using a top-down method, making it difficult to obtain nanoscale ultrafine particles. This results in the inability of active elements inside the particles to contribute to reaction charges. Therefore, the development of nanoscale MAX powder particle preparation technology is crucial [16,17].',\n",

Metal-based composites incorporating MAX powder exhibit not only high strength, modulus, and hardness but also demonstrate excellent machinability, friction, and wear resistance, as well as significant damping capacity. There exists a certain contradiction between the mechanical properties and damping capacity of composite materials [267,268]. Specifically, while the addition of hard and brittle dispersed particles (such as SiC) can enhance the mechanical properties of composites, it can also pin dislocation movement, thereby affecting damping performance. Therefore, it is proposed that by replacing traditional hard and brittle reinforcements with MAX powders possessing plastic deformation and high toughness, the pinning effect on dislocation movement can be minimized, thus achieving a synergistic enhancement of both strength and damping capacity [269].',\n",

The obtained MXene has richer active sites and a larger specific surface area, which can enable MXene to exhibit higher reaction activity and efficiency in catalysis, sensing, and energy storage [270]. Large-sized MAX grains typically contribute to the formation of a uniform MXene layer structure while maintaining more consistent surface properties and higher electrochemical conductivity [271,272].

MAXs are renowned for their exceptional conductivity, wear resistance, corrosion resistance, and high-temperature stability. These attributes render MAXs highly effective in high-current and high-frequency applications, particularly during frequent switching and contact separation processes. They effectively minimize arc and contact point wear, thereby prolonging equipment lifespan. Furthermore, the antioxidant properties of MAXs ensure stable electrical contact performance in harsh environments, such as humidity and corrosive gases [12,282]. Notably, silver-based electrical contact composite materials containing 10% Ti3AlC2(by volume) exhibit performance comparable to commercial AgCdO composite materials [11,283,284,285]. Additionally, incorporating Ti3AlC2MAX significantly enhances the welding resistance and simplifies the processing of electrical contact materials. The pursuit of non-toxic, high-performance electrical contact materials has emerged as a focal point in this field [286].',\n",
       "  'Connecting materials are used to bond two or more components together. MAX bulk materials can provide stronger mechanical properties and thermal stability when connecting complex ceramic, composite materials, and metal components, especially exhibiting significant advantages in high temperatures and harsh environments. By solid-state diffusion, Ti3SiC2MAX bulk can bond to Ti3AlC2directly [287]. During the bonding process of Ti3SiC2and Ti3AlC2, it was found that Si and Al undergo mutual diffusion, forming a Ti3(Si1−xAlx)C2solid solution in a pulse current sintering furnace using the rapid current heating method, without the need for any filler compounds or welding agents [288]. It provides a new possibility to seal nuclear fuel cladding tubes onto MAXs.',\n",
       "  'Despite their excellent mechanical properties, the bulk MAX still exhibits brittleness under certain conditions, particularly in stress concentration points or high-impact environments. While the bulk MAX demonstrates good thermal stability at high temperatures, it still faces oxidation issues in extremely high-temperature environments. Long-term exposure to such environments may lead to performance degradation; therefore, there is an urgent need to improve their antioxidant properties. Additionally, the insufficient interfacial bonding strength between the bulk MAX and other materials during the preparation of composite materials could potentially diminish the mechanical properties of the composites. Furthermore, the bulk MAX encounters difficulties in cutting and forming during processing, especially when manufacturing complex-shaped components, resulting in relatively high production costs and potentially limiting their promotion in certain low-cost applications. To address these issues, future research could concentrate on enhancing the antioxidant properties of the materials, strengthening interfacial bonding, and developing more efficient processing technologies, thereby expanding the application areas of the bulk MAX.',\n",

The self-lubricating, mechanical properties, conductivity, and thermal conductivity make MAX thin films represent the application potential in electronics and electrical engineering. Moreover, MAX thin films exhibit extremely high thermal stability and oxidation resistance under high-temperature conditions, making them highly durable in corrosive and radiation environments.

       "  'Although pure metal coatings are widely used in various industries, their weak atomic bonding forces render them susceptible to wear and corrosion in frictional and chemical environments. Moreover, they tend to oxidize in high temperatures and corrosive media, thereby diminishing their performance. In contrast, MAX thin film materials exhibit exceptional wear resistance and corrosion resistance, owing to their unique layered structure and strong covalent bonding. The M-A-X bonding endows the material with high hardness and friction resistance, while its chemical stability maintains its structural integrity in acidic and alkaline environments. MAXs retain excellent oxidation resistance even at high temperatures. Therefore, when combined with metals, they significantly enhance the wear and corrosion resistance of coatings, offering more reliable protection and extending the service life of coatings under harsh conditions. Jamshidi et al. [289] explored the tribological and corrosion behavior of Al/Ti3SiC2composite coatings and discovered that Al-MAX composite coatings exhibit higher corrosion potential and lower corrosion current density compared to pure aluminum coatings. Additionally, the dense oxide film formed by the MAX not only enhances the surface friction reduction performance of the coating but also prevents external material erosion in certain high-temperature extreme environments, significantly broadening the application range and service environment of this type of composite coating.',\n",
       "  'MAX films are superior to traditional graphite in terms of self-lubricating performance, thermal conductivity, and high-temperature oxidation resistance, making them significantly advantageous as friction lubrication components in extreme environments such as strong acids, strong bases, and high temperatures [290,291]. Shi et al. [292] studied the tribological behavior of NiAI-Ti3SiC2-MoS2composite materials and found that MoS2+\\u2009Ti3SiC2/NiAl-based composite lubricating materials achieved good synergistic lubrication in a wide temperature range from room temperature to 800\\xa0°C. The friction coefficient at 400\\xa0°C was only 0.13, and the lubrication effect was supported by a friction film composed of oxide film. MoS2had the main lubrication effect at medium and low temperatures, while the MAX provided a lubrication effect at high temperatures. This type of composite material is expected to perform well in continuous heating environments and is a promising wear-resistant and high-temperature application material. The research results of Zhou et al. [293] show that an increased MAX content can improve the anti-friction performance of composite coatings. In addition, due to the introduction of MAX, the Al2O3oxide film generated on the surface of the coating at high temperatures not only improves the surface anti-friction performance but also enhances the high-temperature oxidation resistance of the coating.',\n",
       "  'High-temperature protective coatings play a crucial role in various fields, including aerospace, energy, chemical, automotive, and electronics. Compared to traditional coatings, MAXs demonstrate exceptional thermal stability and oxidation resistance at elevated temperatures. Additionally, their superior thermal conductivity and self-lubricating properties enable them to effectively reduce friction under extreme operating conditions, thereby significantly enhancing the durability and reliability of the coatings [294,295]. The composite oxides formed by the oxidation of metal elements in the coating at high temperatures, such as TiO2and Al2O3, can effectively enhance the bonding strength between the coating and the substrate. Especially after the formation of multi-layer structures, the interface bonding between the coating and the substrate becomes even more compact [2]. MAX coating films serve as a protective coating for refractory alloys and a bonding coating in thermal barrier coatings (TBC) systems. The coefficient of thermal expansion is crucial for reducing stress and avoiding coating peeling. Specifically, the CTE of Cr2AlC (12.0–13.3\\u2009×\\u200910–6K−1) is relatively high, making it suitable for protective layers in metal systems. The thermal expansion coefficients of Ti2AlC and Ti3AlC2are relatively low, ranging from 8.2 to 9.0\\u2009×\\u200910–6K−1, and they exhibit better thermal expansion matching with TBC compounds, making them more suitable for use as bonding layers in thermal barrier coatings [274,296,297].',\n",

The neutron irradiation activity of MAX, including Ti3SiC2, Ti3AlC2, and Ti2AlC, is comparable to that of SiC materials and is three orders of magnitude lower than that of Alloy 617 nickel-based alloys [300,301].',\n",
       "  'V2AlC coating exhibits a unique gradient structure along its growth direction. In the region close to the substrate surface, the grains are smaller with more interfaces, whereas in the region farther from the substrate surface, the grains gradually grow larger. This gradient distribution effectively suppresses the excessive aggregation and growth of helium bubbles, thereby enhancing the protective performance of the coating [302]. Ti3AlC2and Ti3SiC2demonstrate remarkable radiation tolerance upon exposure to high-energy ions like Xe and Kr. Despite being irradiated at high doses, such as 25–30 dpa (displacement per atom), they retain their crystal structure and exhibit rapid self-healing capabilities [303]. Ti3AlC2demonstrates a stronger resilience against radiation damage, exhibiting excellent radiation resistance at both low (50\\xa0K) and room temperature (300\\xa0K) conditions. Although Ti3SiC2also exhibits high radiation resistance, it tends to undergo amorphization at higher doses. This amorphization primarily stems from the weaker bonding of Si–C bonds, whereas the Ti–Al and Ti–C bonds in Ti3AlC2are more stable, enabling them to withstand radiation damage and recover swiftly. Additionally, both Ti3AlC2and Ti3SiC2consist of elements with low atomic number (Z), ensuring they do not significantly activate radioactivity under prolonged radiation, which is crucial in nuclear protective materials.',\n",

Introducing coatings can enhance their durability, corrosion resistance, and stability in high-temperature and high-pressure environments, thereby ensuring reliable performance under various extreme conditions. It is crucial to screen coating materials with exceptional corrosion resistance, strength, and stability suitable for extreme environments. Compared to commonly used coating materials such as metals, polymers, and ceramics, MAX films exhibit excellent corrosion resistance, good conductivity thermal conductivity, and flexible machinability. The MAX film coatings on the surface of metal bipolar plates can significantly improve their corrosion resistance and conductivity, presenting considerable application prospects in commercial fuel cells [304]. The MAX film coating exhibits extremely low interfacial contact resistance (ICR) and demonstrates excellent corrosion resistance and durability [305]. In the future, it is necessary to further improve the chemical bonding force and mechanical anchoring effect between the coating and the substrate, such as nitriding or the introduction of transition layers and gradient composite layers. By controlling the changes in composition and structure, gradual transition can be achieved, reducing stress concentration between the coating and the substrate, thereby enhancing the bonding force between the interface, breaking through the interface bonding between MAX coating and substrate materials, constructing integrated electrode materials, and optimizing their functionality.',\n",

Although pure copper has excellent conductivity and thermal conductivity, its welding resistance is limited. During the surface melting process triggered by arc discharge and Joule heating, the contacts tend to bond, making separation challenging, which in turn compromises the equipment’s disconnection capability. Currently, copper alloys, copper-based composite materials, and copper–ceramic composite materials are widely used as new electrical contact materials, particularly in applications such as pantograph slides, high-voltage switch contacts, and conductive slip rings. MAX films possess strong oxidation resistance, allowing them to maintain performance in high-temperature oxidation environments. These characteristics enable MAXs to provide long-term reliable performance under harsh working conditions. Furthermore, the layered structure endows them with exceptional mechanical strength and toughness, enhancing their durability underwear and impact conditions, particularly suitable for electrical contact applications involving repeated insertion and high-frequency operations. For instance, Ti2AlN [306], Ti3SiC2[307], and a series of MAX [308] are sputtered on n-type GaN, SiC, or Cu substrates and demonstrate a low ohmic contact resistivity. The deposited MAX film coating serves as an oxygen barrier, preventing potential oxidation, contamination, or the need for any cleaning steps, thereby enhancing the long-term stability of the device. MAX film coating exhibits a higher thermal capacity and a lower thermal conductivity. Under the influence of an arc, the pure metal coating undergoes significant melting and recrystallization, whereas the composite MAX film coating remains largely unaffected, indicating that MAX film coatings have the potential to serve as protective materials for electrical contact surfaces.',\n",

When light irradiates thermoelectric materials non-uniformly, the photothermal effect induces localized temperature changing and creates a temperature gradient. This gradient causes photogenerated carriers to redistribute towards both colder and the hotter ends, establishing a potential difference along the gradient and facilitating thermoelectric conversion. Leveraging interaction between photothermal and thermoelectric processes, the PTE effect holds promise for applications in high-efficiency photoelectric energy harvesting and high-performance photoelectric detection3,4. As semiconductor devices shrink to nanometer scales, nanowire (NW) materials have garnered significant attention in nanophotonics and nanoelectronics5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12. The larger surface area of NWs provides more active sites for reactions in electrochemical cell, facilitating a greater number of reactants to interact with the electrode surface, which in turn enhances the reaction rate. Additionally, the increased surface area reduces the resistance to ion diffusion in the electrolyte, improving the response time of photoelectrochemical (PEC) devices. III-V group compound semiconductor NWs, in particular, exhibit unique physical and chemical properties alongside excellent photoelectric characteristic such as large specific surface area, lattice anisotropy, tunable size, high crystallinity, and controllable optical and electrical properties13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26.

Additionally, peculiar PTE bipolar impulse detection characteristics are observed in GaON/GaN NWs electrochemical cell according Fig.2band enlarged curves in Supplementary Fig.9, demonstrating a distinct two-stage photocurrent behavior. In the first stage, a prominent photocurrent pulse attributed to both the photovoltaic effect (Ipv) and the PTE effect (Ite) is observed, stemming from transient temperature differences along the NWs upon light activation. In the second stage, with constant temperature maintained under continuous UV light irradiation, the photocurrent stabilizes at a lower level after the thermoelectric effect diminishes, primarily reflectingIpv. Additionally, we conducted a detailed analysis of the factors contributing to the difference in dark current between the two devices. The difference in dark current between the two devices is primarily attributed to several factors. Firstly, the GaON/GaN heterojunction exhibits a type-II band structure, which significantly influences the dark current characteristics of the devices. Secondly, the energy band structure of the type-II GaON/GaN heterojunction enables carrier tunneling across the junction, further increasing the dark current density. Thirdly, the introduction of GaON via post-annealing with oxygen plasma treatment could induce surface states in the NWs and defects at the GaON/GaN heterojunction interface. These surface states participate in electrochemical reactions, further accounting for an increase in dark current density. The linear relationship observed between photocurrent and incident light power (Fig.2c) across the two stages suggests that GaON/GaN NWs electrochemical cells hold promise for UV light detection.

Additionally, Supplementary Fig.14and Supplementary Fig.15illustrate the I-t characteristic curves of the two devices under different illumination conditions (255-310\\u2009nm). Notably, GaON/GaN NWs devices exhibit higher thermoelectric bipolar pulse photocurrent spikes compared to GaN NWs devices under identical UV light illumination. This enhancement is attributed to the higher electric field within the GaON layer (refer to Fig.3i), facilitating increased transport of photogenerated carriers to the NWs both ends, thereby increasing the photocurrent density. From the I-t characteristic in Fig.3a, a pulse detection cycle is identified, delineated into four phases: a sharp rise, a stable plateau, a sharp decline, and another stable plateau, marked as I, II, III, and IV, respectively, as indicated in Fig.3b. Furthermore, Fig.3c,ddistinctly illustrate transient (Phases I and III) and steady-state (Phase II) photoresponse characteristics across the 255\\u2009nm to 365\\u2009nm range. Keithley 2611B source-meter drives light emitting diodes (LEDs) to maintain a relatively stable optical power output, calibrated at 1\\u2009mW/cm2across these wavelengths by using Thorlabs PM100D optical power meter. In GaON/GaN NW devices, the current density in phase I and III is primarily governed by the thermoelectric current arising from the photothermoelectric effect. Since the output power of LEDs is identical, the thermoelectric responsivity remains constant, leading to a negligible variation in current with respect to wavelength. In phase II, under UV illumination, the current density is mainly governed by the photovoltaic effect, with photogenerated carriers influenced by the material’s band gap. The larger band gap of GaON makes it more difficult to absorb UV light at 365\\u2009nm, resulting in a notable decrease in current. As the wavelength decreases and photon energy increases, GaON is capable of absorbing higher-energy photons, which causes the current behavior at shorter wavelengths to remain relatively stable. Notably, within this wavelength band, the photocurrent amplitudes of phases I/III and phase II in GaON/GaN electrochemical cells are higher than those of GaN devices, underscoring their potential for operation in the UVA-UVC spectrum.',\n",

The response time and recovery time in the I-t characteristic refer to the duration for the photocurrent to rise from 10% to 90% of its peak and decline from 90% back to 10%, respectively. Under self-powered conditions, when irradiated with 365\\u2009nm light at 1\\u2009mW/cm2, the GaN NWs electrochemical cell shows response time and recovery time of 41.3\\u2009ms/37.4\\u2009ms and 886\\u2009ms/529.4\\u2009ms for the phases I/III photocurrent spikes.

Furthermore, with an applied external bias to the NWs, the photocurrent pulse spikes due to thermoelectric effect in the GaON/GaN device progressively increase with increasing bias voltage. This demonstrates that the electric field profile effectively enhances the photoresponse of the electrochemical cells. Consetquently, under the combined influence of external bias and photothermoelectric effect, a greater number of photogenerated carriers migrate to the NWs ends, thereby amplifying the photocurrent.',\n",
       "  'To elucidate the internal physical mechanism underlying the correlation between thermoelectric potential and bipolar current response, simulation analysis is performed using COMSOL Multiphysics, integrating electromagnetic and heat transfer modules. Figure4a–dillustrates the transient temperature and potential distributions along a single GaON/GaN NW upon the initiation and termination of illumination, respectively. Upon the onset of UV light (Phase I), a temperature gradient generates from GaON side to GaN side. Based on the simulation results from Fig.4h,i, GaON exhibits a higher Seebeck coefficient than GaN under similar temperature and doping conditions. This higher Seebeck coefficient contributes to a larger thermoelectric figure of merit (ZT) according to the formulaZT=S2σT/k, whereS,σ,Tandkdenote the Seebeck coefficient, electrical conductivity, absolute temperature and thermal conductivity, respectively. The elevated Seebeck coefficient of GaON accelerates temperature increase under UV irradiation, establishing a hot end at the GaON side and a cold end at the bottom of GaN side. The resulting thermoelectric electromotive force directs energy from the substrate toward the GaON side (Fig.4b), inducing an upward tilt in the energy band, as shown in Fig.4e. Upon the cessation of UV illumination (Phase III), the bottom region becomes the hot end while the GaON region of NW serves as the cold end, generating a thermoelectric electromotive force from the GaON side toward the substrate (Fig.4d). This causes a downward tilt in the energy band, illustrated in Fig.4f. Additionally, the relationship between the thermoelectric response of GaON/GaN device and the temperature distribution is experimentally verified as shown in Supplementary Fig.16, the overall trend indicates that the GaON/GaN heterojunction NWs device effectively generates a significant temperature gradient, further supporting the thermoelectric effect induced by the temperature variation during light switching.',\n",

       "  'Figure4gillustrates the PTE effect governing carrier transport processes and the thermoelectric potential distribution of GaON/GaN NWs electrochemical cells across phases I-IV. Due to the higher electron energy at the hot end, more electrons migrate from the high-temperature region to the low-temperature region. In phase I, the photogenerated holes migrate to GaON side of GaON/GaN NWs under illumination, while electrons are transported to GaN side and collected by the substrate electrode. The resulting thermoelectric electromotive force promotes holes transfer towards the GaON surface to participate in the OER, enhancing the positive current signal. At this stage, photocurrent density (Ipv+Ite1) dominants in phase I. Subsequent stable UV radiation light equalizes temperatures at GaON/GaN NWs, eliminating the light-induced temperature gradient and the thermoelectric force in phase II. As a result, photocurrent rapidly stabilizes to a plateau dominated by photovoltaic effect. Due to the high level of dark current, the current produced by the photovoltaic effect becomes overwhelmed by this background current. In phase III, the GaON/GaN NWs undergo a prolonged steady-state process during phase II before the light is turned off. Upon cessation of illumination, transient temperature differences reverse thermoelectric potential from phase I, resulting in a thermoelectric electromotive force from the GaON to the GaN and generating a negative current spike. Under the influence of the thermoelectric field, both the direction and amplitude of the current are different from the process I, and marked asIte2. Notably, the change in the temperature gradient between these phases leads to different thermoelectric behaviors, meaning thatIte1≠Ite2. This reverse pulse current serves as a crucial feature upon UV light termination. Finally, in phase IV, as the temperature difference diminishes between NW ends, thermoelectric potential dissipates, sustaining current at the dark current level, marked asIdark.',\n",

To map the electronic band structure in the entire first surface Brillouin zone (BZ), a photon energy exceeding 20\\xa0eV is typically required, as the maximum accessible momentum vector depends on the kinetic energy of the photoelectrons2. Although laser-based laboratory table-top setups have traditionally been limited either to photon energies below 10\\xa0eV through frequency conversion in nonlinear optical crystals3,4,5or low-repetition-rate lasers for efficient high-harmonic generation (HHG)6,7,8,9,10, recent advancements in high-average-power and high-repetition-rate laser sources have enabled the development of high-flux ARPES measurements using HHG11,12,13,14. In addition, pulsed light sources enable the study of nonequilibrium carrier and lattice dynamics on an ultrafast timescale, achieved by employing an additional optical pump pulse with an adjustable relative delay to the probe pulse. Such time-resolved ARPES (tr-ARPES) studies encompass a broad spectrum of materials and phenomena15,16, including topological insulators4,17,18, high-temperature superconductors19, charge density wave insulators20,21, and multiparticle excitations, such as excitons22,23,24and orbital d-d transitions25.',\n",
       "  'The introduction of momentum microscopes for photoelectron detection marks another significant step in tr-ARPES experiments. Conventional ARPES analyzers capture a narrow electron momentum cut in the photoelectron distribution and subsequently filter electrons by energy26. However, this approach requires varying the azimuthal and polar angles of the sample to map larger momentum space areas, such as the entire first BZ. This limitation can be overcome in photoemission electron microscopes (PEEM) operating in momentum mode, also called momentum microscopes (MM). Here, photoelectrons are accelerated by a high electric field (>\\u200910\\xa0kV) towards the objective lens of the microscope, drastically increasing its angular acceptance. When operating in real-space mode instead, MMs can probe the real-space distribution of the photoelectrons. The unique combination of the two operation modes within the same instrument offers the additional advantage of performing position-dependent ARPES scans on small sample sizes, such as exfoliated structures of van der Waals layered materials27,28,29.',\n",
       "  'One possibility to detect photoelectrons in a MM is to use a hemispherical analyzer, which categorizes the electron kinetic energy by their trajectories through an electrostatic field. Hemispherical analyzers enable usage of continuous-wave light sources with high flux and narrow bandwidth for static experiments but require scanning the kinetic energies individually. A second possibility to discriminate the kinetic energy of the photoelectrons is to equip the MM with a time-of-flight (TOF) detector, which determines the electron kinetic energy by time-of-flight in a drift tube. This allows simultaneous mapping of electron momenta and energies in parallel, significantly reducing the required integration time11. In addition, TOF detectors provide a high dynamic range and energy resolution9. While being a viable alternative or add-on to MM detectors using a hemispherical analyzer, they require pulsed light sources with appropriate repetition rates, which typically limit the energy resolution of the instrument to the available bandwidth of the laser pulses26and the XUV photon energy used16.',\n",
       "  'In general, in photoemission experiments, the acquisition time is primarily dictated by the number of emitted electrons per second. However, in pulsed laser-assisted photoemission, exciting multiple electrons per optical pulse initiates Coulomb interactions between them. This interaction not only significantly shifts the acquired spectrum, but also compromises the energy resolution, leading to the so-called space charge limit26,30,31,32. Overcoming this problem requires extreme ultraviolet (XUV) sources with high repetition rates, preferably in the multi-100\\xa0kHz to 1\\xa0MHz range, depending on the system to be studied. With respect to the required pulse duration, a compromise needs to be met: although a short pulse duration is required to achieve good time resolution and conversion efficiency to the XUV, the resulting broadband pulses limit the energy resolution of the experiment, which is a well-known compromise to be made in tr-ARPES experiments. HHG without additional pulse compression addresses this limitation, achieving energy resolutions down to a few tens of meV33,34,35, albeit with repetition rates typically below 250\\xa0kHz and low conversion efficiency due to well-known pre-ionization effects in HHG. In particular, a light source with switchable energy and time resolution to exploit both advantages has only been reported with photon energies of up to 7.2 eV36or without integration into a tr-ARPES setup14.',\n",

Coupling these Yb lasers to passive enhancement cavities allows access to XUV sources with repetition rates\\u2009>\\u200910\\xa0MHz and a high usable flux12,13,38,39. Another more widespread approach with larger flexibility, particularly at repetition rates in the hundreds of kilohertz targeted here, involves external nonlinear post-compression of the optical pulses generated by high-repetition-rate Yb laser systems to generate XUV photons. To date, this has been the main method of choice for tr-ARPES, and setups with repetition rates up to 1\\xa0MHz and pulse durations of the order of 50\\xa0fs have been realized2,11,40. External nonlinear pulse compression employs self-phase modulation (SPM), induced by the Kerr effect, to spectrally broaden narrow-bandwidth pulses, thus supporting a shorter transform-limited temporal duration. The pulses can subsequently be recompressed in time by eliminating residual chirp from SPM and other dispersion sources. For high pulse energies (millijoule regime), most standard compression setups are gas-filled hollow-core capillaries41and filament compressors42. However, these methods are difficult to scale in terms of repetition rate and average power without increasing complexity and size, and their overall efficiencies are low, which is highly critical when HHG is targeted at high repetition rates, where the pulse energies available are more moderate.',\n",

To reliably tune the XUV flux to the onset of the space charge limit, we monitor the photoemission spectrum while systematically reducing the Ar gas pressure and increasing the distance between the Ar nozzle and the laser focus to decrease the photon flux artificially.

The electrons are subsequently filtered by energy in the hemispherical analyzer with an adjustable entrance slit size and pass energy for an energy resolution down to 22 meV.

The deviation in our system could arise from several reasons: First, the bandpass coating of the XUV monochromator might be too broad or misalignment could induce slight geometric dispersion. In contrast to grating monochromators, where the exit slit size and grating groove density tune the transmitted bandwidth9,40, multilayer mirrors have a fixed setting and can only be replaced by a set with adapted coating. Second, misalignment or spatial inhomogeneities in the beam profile might increase the pulse duration. Finally, pump pulses longer than the probe XUV pulses compromise the time-resolution in our experiments. Here, additional compression stages could be implemented for the pump to better match the XUV pulse duration. Fine-tuning the monochromator bandpass setting to balance photon flux and energy resolution is also feasible, particularly if the generated harmonics are monitored using an XUV spectrometer. Despite the current limitations, the demonstrated tunability of our setup is valuable for experiments requiring a trade-off between energy and time resolution.

       " 'paper_22.html': ['High-brightness coherent light offers a unique opportunity to capture a phenomenon that no other method is capable of capturing, such as molecular dynamics in real time (i.e., femtoseconds)1,2,3. A particle accelerator, specifically a free-electron laser (FEL) linear particle accelerator (linac), is required to generate such light4,5. The factors essential to achieving high beam brightness are a large peak current, a low emittance, a short pulse time, and a high repetition rate, where emittance is defined as the volume of the six-dimensional phase space of the position and momentum of the beam. A short pulse time and high repetition rate can be readily attained by using photocathodes instead of thermionic cathodes. Therefore, photocathodes have been used to operate advanced accelerators since the 1980s, including the Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS) of the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC)6. Because of their reliability and robustness, metals such as copper (Cu), magnesium (Mg), and silver (Ag) are the most common type of photocathodes used to generate an FEL in linear accelerator facility operations7,8,9. The drawback of these metals is large work functions, which require ultraviolet (UV) light for photo-electron emission and result in a low quantum efficiency (QE) of approximately 0.01%. Third or fourth harmonics of a short-pulse infrared (IR) or visible-light (VL) laser are generally required to achieve the necessary UV light; thus, optical setups are complex, resulting in low conversion efficiency and low laser stability10. QE is defined as the number of photoelectrons emitted per incident photon, thus, a low QE leads to a low peak current. Alternatives to metal photocathodes include cesiated gallium arsenide (GaAs), which exhibits a high QE of up to 10% with VL excitation11. This high QE has led to the use of cesiated GaAs in the compact energy recovery linac (cERL) at the High Energy Accelerator Research Organization in Japan12,13. The cERL beam requirement is more than 10\\xa0mA average current, less than 1 mm·mrad normalized emittance, and a long photocathode lifetime of several weeks or more (equivalent to 104C or more as the amount of extraction charge). The challenge is the extreme susceptibility of cesiated GaAs to environmental conditions because of an atomically thin layer of an alkali metal, cesium, that is used to create negative electron affinity surfaces (operates at 10–9Pa)14. Cesium telluride (Cs2Te) photocathodes also exhibits a high QE of more than 10% and are more robust than cesiated GaAs (operates at 10–7to 10–6Pa). This makes Cs2Te photocathodes one of the attractive candidates for generating a high-brightness electron beam, which is why these photocathodes are being used in the last-generation x-ray FEL (XFEL)-based user facility15,16,17. However, Cs2Te photocathodes require UV excitation similar to the metal photocathode.',\n",

However, the pressing technical challenges for implementing K2CsSb photocathodes on accelerators are (1) the lack of a universal deposition recipe to achieve crystal stoichiometry and (2) its susceptibility to vacuum contamination. To tackle these challenges, the first step is to understand the correlation between the deposition recipe and the elemental compositions of photocathode thin films, especially regarding depth.

This is consistent with our previous report, which demonstrated that silicon and molybdenum behave the same regarding the quantum efficiency of deposited K2CsSb when they are coated with graphene33. The QE of the films with 532\\xa0nm excitation during deposition is shown in Fig.2(a). We monitored the QE using a metal ring anode and a picoammeter. Our deposition recipe is as follows. First, we thermally clean the substrates by heating to around 500\\xa0°C for 1\\xa0h. After cleaning, we decrease the temperatures to 100\\xa0°C and maintain it throughout the deposition. We deposit approximately 15\\xa0nm of antimony, which does not yield a detectable increase in the QE. Next, we deposit potassium and start to see some increase in the QE (in the range of 1%). We stop potassium depositions when the QE reaches its peak. Finally, we finish with cesium deposition, during which we see a gradual increase of QE up to approximately 7%. We transported the photocathodes for SR-XPS depth profiling using our vacuum suitcase. The stoichiometry ratio of potassium (K) and cesium (Cs) to antimony (Sb) was approximately two for as-grown films (i.e., prior to sputtering). The results indicate that the films have excess cesium at the surface with respect to the theoretical stoichiometry of crystalline potassium cesium antimonide K2CsSb. We cannot conclude whether excess cesium is forming a cesium monolayer on the surface or is incorporated in the films. Regardless, the results provide the important insight that using our described recipe, excess cesium exists on the surface of deposited potassium cesium antimonide.',\n",

We observed an immediate decrease in the ratio of potassium and cesium to antimony with respect to film depth (Fig.2(b)). The rate of decrease was nearly linear with distance and was constant throughout the entire film thickness.',\n",

Fig.3(a)shows the QE to deposition time plot for the Seq-ep method. Specifically, we waited until the QE dropped off completely rather than stopping at the peak during potassium deposition.

       "  'Interestingly, we observed an immediate difference in surface elemental composition: It was close to K2CsSb and without excess cesium. Even more interesting was that the stoichiometry of K2CsSb was maintained considerably deeper into the films, in contrast to the films deposited using our conventional K-deficit method. These results suggest that increasing the potassium content in sequential deposition of potassium cesium antimonide could have supplied sufficient potassium for cesium to react to form the theoretical stoichiometry of K2CsSb. However, obtaining the same maximum QE for films with a clear difference in surface stoichiometries and depth profiles emphasizes the need for caution in assuming the stoichiometry of alkali antimonide photocathode thin films based on their QE. Our results indicate that this is especially true for sequentially deposited alkali antimonide thin films. Our depth profiles suggest cesium diffusion is enhanced for the K sufficient films compared the K deficit films. A possible explanation is that there is a difference in the average density of atomic packing for K-Sb films deposited by the two methods. Specifically, an in situ x-ray diffraction study on sequential thermal deposition of K-Cs-Sb films has revealed that cubic K3Sb coexists with hexagonal K3Sb prior to the cesium deposition20. K-Sb in our K-sufficient films may have lower average density atomic packing structure, for example, with increased cubic K3Sb crystal structure compared to hexagonal K3Sb.',\n",

Nitinol’s exceptional corrosion resistance makes it highly valuable across diverse industries. In biomedical applications, such as cardiovascular stents, guidewires, and orthopedic implants, it ensures biocompatibility and prevents ion leaching, enhancing patient safety. Its use extends to aerospace, where it provides long-term reliability in actuators and fasteners exposed to demanding environments. In the oil and gas sector, Nitinol’s resilience ensures the durability of downhole tools in corrosive fluids, while in automotive applications, its stability supports the performance of temperature-sensitive components like thermostat valves, ensuring consistent functionality across all fields. This renders them useful in a wide range of fields, including energy, smart sensors, and robotics, in addition to biomedical devices and aerospace components5,6,7,8. Nevertheless, the conventional production of NiTi has encountered difficulties such as the formation of burrs, work hardening, higher titanium reactivity compared to nickel, high ductility, and the resilience spring back effect9,10. Moreover, during the fabrication of Nitinol parts, vacuum casting is often used to avoid impurities such as C, N, and O to prevent the formation of detrimental secondary phase components, such as TiO2, TiC, and Ti4Ni2Ox, that might arise during traditional casting or powder metallurgy processes11.',\n",

The precision and control with which L-PBF can be used to produce complex metallic structures are reasons for its widespread adoption12,13. The fast heating and cooling caused by the high energy density of the laser beam results in a nonequilibrium metallurgical process. This makes it possible to produce novel microstructures and achieve breakthroughs in performance14. The fast growing rate of adoption of L-PBF, along with the use of NiTi for various applications, has sparked a surge of scientific research focused on elucidating the complex correlation between L-PBF process variables and the produced NiTi part characteristics15,16.',\n",

The process parameters affect the properties of the produced Nitinol part, altering its mechanical and functional properties such as hardness, tensile strength, fatigue strength, ductility, shape memory effect, biocompatibility, and fracture toughness. The process parameters, can however, induce porosity, internal stresses, selective Ni-loss due to evaporation, precipitate or intermetallic formation affecting the phase transformation temperatures, and generate a high density of dislocations20,21.',\n",

VED encapsulates the energy input per unit volume during the melting and solidification of material layers. This composite metric encompasses the laser power, scanning speed, and layer thickness used during L-PBF fabrication and is commonly used for generating a design space map that indicates how the process parameters influence the final material properties26.

The reduction in relative peak intensities with increasing VED indicates higher residual stresses in samples S1 and S2. This phenomenon is associated with non-uniform thermal gradients during the L-PBF process, which induce lattice distortions and lead to residual stress accumulation.

In general, achieving high density is desirable and it is important therefore to consider which parameters could give the highest densities. In our work, it is clear that higher relative densities in NiTi samples correspond to higher microhardness values.

In contrast, S4, which has a lower relative density of 98.01%, also shows a lower microhardness of 265\\xa0HV.

During the AM process, the material undergoes transformation from powder particles to liquid (L), which then rapidly cools to form the solid (S). It is well reported that L-S transformation at a higher cooling rate results in increased thermal and residual stresses33. Furthermore, the material is subjected to heating and cooling cycles with each built layer. For the higher VED, this has resulted in multiple gain formation with different orientations at the base of the melt pool. This is achieved through two driving mechanisms: dynamic recovery (DRV) and recrystallisation (Rx). The driving forces for this arise from the fluctuating spatio-temporal local temperature field. During DRV, the dislocations tend to cluster as low-angle grain boundaries (LAGB) and high-angle grain boundaries (HAGB) to reduce the total free energy. This process is aided through a slip/climb dislocation movement mechanism34,35. Typically, a LAGB tends to form low energy configurations of dislocations in regular arrays. However, in materials with low stacking fault energy (NiTi) they form a random tangled structure36,37. Alongside, LAGBs tend to move towards high energy sites in the grains, which are usually the grain boundaries. Accumulation of LAGBs at the grain boundaries results in a localized increase of inelastic strain, which then acts as a driving force for the initiation of Rx. Recrystallization tends to occur at multiple locations, mostly along the grain boundaries, shear bands, transition bands, and triple junctions of grain boundaries. In AM, melt pool boundaries and their intersection sites also act as nucleation sites, as recorded in Fig.3. Such recrystallization is generally heterogeneous in nature with high strain dependency and is generally known as discontinuous dynamic recrystallization (DDRx). It is well documented that the DDRx is directly related to the Zener-Hollomon parameter38.',\n",

In our previous study, we measured the process temperature using IR sensors and correlated this with resulting residual stress levels40. It is evident that the sample with higher VED had increased residual stress at the base of the melt pool, which can contribute to more DDRx. Although DDRx promotes grain refinement, equiaxed grain structures are not visible throughout the samples due to the highly rapid and stochastic nature of grain boundary and growth, resulting from the thermal fields from subsequent layer depositions.',\n",

Here, on purpose, the electrochemical tests were carried out for S2 (produced with the high laser energy density of 64.3\\xa0J/mm3), and S3 (produced with the lower laser energy density of 26.7\\xa0J/mm3). Figure4a shows the potentiodynamic polarization curve for S2 and S3 in the XY and XZ planes in 3.5% NaCl at 18\\xa0°C. The average values for corrosion current (Icorr), corrosion potential (Ecorr), pitting potential (Epit), and corrosion rate (mmpy) were evaluated using the Tafel exploration method from the polarization curves and are listed in Table4. In general, both the samples show similar passivation and pitting corrosion behavior in both the XY and XZ planes. The corrosion current density is significantly lower for S2 compared to S3 in the XY plane. Similarly, S2 outperforms the S3 specimen in the XZ plane. Nevertheless, the pitting potential for the S2 sample is higher compared to S3 in both planes. Comparatively, S2 exhibits the lowest corrosion rate of 40.62\\u2009×\\u200910–3mpy in the XY plane and 58.80\\u2009×\\u200910–3mpy in the XZ plane.

Overall, the corrosion resistance of the S2 specimen is approximately twice that of the S3 specimen. Localized pitting behavior of the NiTi specimens was evaluated using pitting potential (Epit). Interestingly, all the tested samples showed the formation of metastable pits, which eventually repassivated. Generally, the Epit–Ecorrrepresents the critical potential for breakdown of the passive layer of the material and is used to determine the pitting corrosion resistance of the material38,41. From Table4, S2 shows 1.83 and 1.95 times higher Epit–Ecorrvalues in the XY plane and XZ plane compared to the S3 sample.

       "  'In comparing L-PBF with alternative Nitinol manufacturing processes, prior research42has highlighted that air plasma spraying (APS) and high velocity oxy-fuel (HVOF) coatings are hindered by microstructural challenges such as microcracks and interparticle boundaries, which compromise corrosion resistance by facilitating electrolyte penetration and localized corrosion initiation. APS coatings, in particular, exhibit high oxide content and microcracks that obstruct effective passivation. Although HVOF coatings show somewhat improved passive behavior, they still suffer from inherent inhomogeneities that negatively impact corrosion performance. In contrast, NiTi produced by L-PBF demonstrates significantly superior corrosion resistance, attributed to its dense, crack-free microstructure that minimizes electrolyte ingress and supports the formation of a stable TiO2passive layer. Our L-PBF samples exhibited corrosion rates between 0.040 and 0.092 mpy in 3.5% NaCl solution, surpassing the performance of APS coatings (1.15\\xa0mpy) by up to 29 times and HVOF coatings (0.17 mpy) by nearly 2 times. Additionally, while APS and HVOF coatings displayed breakdown potentials around 100–120\\xa0mV vs. SCE, indicating vulnerability to localized corrosion, our L-PBF samples achieved breakdown potentials ranging from 300 to 670\\xa0mV, depending on specific processing parameters. Unlike thermal spray methods, which often necessitate substantial surface treatments to enhance corrosion resistance, L-PBF-produced parts are inherently dense and require minimal post-processing. Consequently, L-PBF provides superior corrosion protection through a uniform, low-porosity structure that fosters durable passive layer formation and mitigates defect-induced corrosion initiation.',\n",

Figure4b,c shows the bode magnitude vs. frequency and phase vs. frequency plots whereas Fig.4d shows the Nyquist plots for all the specimens. It is evident from the Bode-magnitude plot (Fig.4b) that, at lower frequencies, the S2 samples showed a higher impedance modulus compared to the S3 samples. The XY plane for the S2 samples showed the highest level of impedance. The measured EIS data were fitted with the electrical equivalent circuit as shown in Fig.5a. The solution resistance of all samples remained almost similar at higher frequencies. The Bode phase angle plot (Fig.4c) is an indication of the capacitive response of the samples. In the current study, all specimens in both test planes show a plateau for a wide range of frequencies as the phase value approaches 90°. The occurrence of a constant phase angle maximum over a wide range of frequencies is indicative of passive surface and shows a near-capacitive behavior43,44. This behavior suggests that the oxide layer is compact and homogenous and all the specimens show two time constants; thus, two RC circuits were used to fit the measured EIS data as shown in Fig.5a.

All the samples show a similar capacitive arc with an unfinished semicircle shape within a frequency range of 10–2Hz to 105Hz. From Fig.4d, it can be seen that the capacitive arc of S2 in the XY plane shows a higher radius compared to S3 in the same XY plane. The resistance Rpof S2-XY reported 1261.0\\u2009×\\u2009103which is around 7 times greater than that of S3 in the XY plane, which observed the Rp value of 190\\u2009×\\u2009103k ohm cm2.

Thus, the specimens printed with higher laser density show superior corrosion resistance with stronger passivation characteristics. On similar lines, lower capacitance of S2 in the XY plane suggests higher corrosion resistance. In addition, all the samples show that the nfand nctvalues, attributed to surface roughness and defects, were less than 1, suggesting a non-ideal capacitive behavior. Interestingly, the nfand nctvalues of S2 in the XY plane are higher compared to the nfand nctvalues of S3. This indicates a smoother passive layer with fewer defects and inhomogenities was formed on the S2 sample compared to the S3 sample. The total resistance (Rf+\\u2009Rct) was chosen as the criterion for judging the corrosion resistance, and its change trend showed the order S2-XY\\u2009<\\u2009S3-XY\\u2009<\\u2009S2-XZ\\u2009<\\u2009S3XZ. The decrease of the total resistance value is related to the decrease of the stability of the passive film and the increase of defects in the passive film. The S2-XY sample showed the best corrosion resistance, which is consistent with the above research results, and the same result can also be seen in potentiodynamic polarization tests, where the corrosion resistance gradually increased with higher laser energy density.',\n",
       "  'Corrosion behavior observed in S2 samples could be attributed to smaller grains in the XZ plane. Influence of grain size on corrosion resistance of a material is well documented49. However, our study specifically investigates the corrosion resistance in the build plane for 3D printed NiTi samples. In our current study, the grain refinement during DDRx in the S2 sample, shown in Fig.3, resulted in increased grain boundaries and thus enhanced corrosion resistance with a compact passive film through increased diffusion of Ni and Ti atoms. S2 was produced at a higher laser energy density, which in turn promoted recrystallization. Smaller grains result in a higher number of grain boundaries, which in turn increases the diffusion coefficient of titanium atoms and promotes the creation of a passivation film on the surface. Figure5b represents the overall mechanism underlying the corrosion behavior of coarse grain vs. refined grain produced via the L-PBF process in both scan (XY) and built (XZ) planes. In the case of the S3 sample, the non-uniformity of the passivation film on the S3 surface suggests a lower level of protection of the interior metal. Thus, a larger number of chloride ions were able to penetrate the thinner passive layer, leading to the initiation of pitting behavior. On the other hand, the S2 sample, which has a thicker and more uniform passive layer, was able to withstand the interaction between chloride ions and the electrolyte-film interface. Furthermore, the higher pitting potential of the S2 specimen keeps the formed oxide layer intact, avoiding the breakdown. Therefore, passive film formed on the NiTi alloy produced with high laser energy density remains protected from harsh environments, thus demonstrating superior resistance to corrosion.',\n",

Nominal distribution of Ni, Ti, Na, and Cl was seen in the pitted region. Selective dissolution of Ni is a common phenomenon observed in NiTi alloys50.

Figure7a shows the wide scans for both samples with the clear presence of Ni, Ti, C, and O. The peaks present are consistent with the presence of titanium, nickel, oxygen, and carbon. Both the samples produced with high and low laser energy density show no change in elemental or peak shift.

The peaks are both broad, indicating a mix of chemical states, with the portion extending to lower binding energies indicating the presence of Ti2O3and TiO, which have binding energies of 457.1 and 455.6\\xa0eV, respectively52. The higher binding energy peak position in S2 supports the dominance of TiO2at this surface, with a shoulder at lower binding energy indicating some Ti2O3. Sample S3 peaks at a lower value, which may indicate a greater proportion of Ti2O3, and extends lower than the peak for S2, supporting some contribution from TiO. Deconvolved components were fit for the Ti peaks (see Fig.7e,f) using Gaussian–Lorentzian functions, with additional components only being included if they reduced the RMS of the fit and contributed a significant (>\\u20095%) share of the peak area. For S2, the 2p 3/2 peak was best fit with three components (at 460.4, 458.4, 456.4\\xa0eV) corresponding best to TiO2, Ti2O3, and TiO, comprising 29%, 20%, and 20% of the total 2p peak area, respectively.

Other compounds may be present in either peak, such as the extension at low binding energy for S2 which may be metallic Ti, but these are below the limits of detection/fitting.

This principle underlies in additive manufacturing of parts by selective laser melting (SLM)1,2,3, directed energy deposition (DED)4,5,6, as well as laser beam welding (LBW)7,8. In these methods, a small dimension of the molten zone and large temperature gradients are typical. As a result, the primary microstructure with long columnar grains is frequently formed. This feature can induce anisotropy in structural characteristics within local domains inside the finished product or weld1,4,7,8,9. In that context, one of the most significant research problems is an analysis of mechanisms that affect the solidification path.

In earlier studies10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17, the analysis of variable electromagnetic fields and constant magnetic fields has been conducted. The influence of electromagnetic fields on crystallization under typical for SLM conditions has been studied in17. It was revealed that a significant impact can only be achieved under high magnetic field strength. Additionally, the MZ size should be larger than the typical for SLM and DED values of between 0.2 and 1\\xa0mm. It is desired that the MZ size is above 1\\xa0mm, as in LBW processing. Another method of influencing the crystallization process is the ultrasonic (US) treatment, which is widely used in casting18,19.

The bubble growth and collapse in molten metal alloys can occur rapidly in\\\\(\\\\sim 30~{\\\\text{\\\\varvec{\\\\upmu}s}}\\\\)30, as revealed by in situ synchrotron X-ray visualization31.

The pores can be classified into three distinct types38,39,40,41. Type 1 pores are characterized by their substantial size (over 100 microns) and irregular shape (sphericity is less than 0.6)39. These defects occur due to an incomplete material fusion, which leads to empty spaces between the powder particles that were not melted. The presence of these defects is also connected to a phenomenon known as the balling effect, wherein the powder particles coalesce into globular spherical particles, hindering the deposition of a metal onto the substrate. Alternatively, the excessive laser energy density can cause formation of deep, narrow melting channels, known as keyholes. The gas or vapor inside the keyhole could be trapped by the liquid phase and kept inside until crystallization. It results in the second type of pores. The size of these pores is relatively large, up to 100 microns41, and their shape is roundish with a sphericity of above 0.742.',\n",

Other mechanisms of gas pore formation include: (1) bubbles formed by metals with low boiling points, like in Al and Mg alloys45, and (2) gas dissolved between powder particles that does not escape from the melt pool during rapid cooling46. Some of these defects can be mitigated through post-processing techniques, such as hot isostatic pressing, which can remove nearly all pores and reduce the porosity from 0.35 to 0.01%48.

In DED, additive processing occurs directly on the surface of the sonotrode, similar to the studies22,23,24. However, there are limitations to this technique because of the sound attenuation as the component increases in size and the reflections of waves with interference patterns near the surface occur.

Furthermore, the voltage-current signals through phase-space reconstruction of the DC electrolysis experiments with various current densities demonstrate that the range of voltage fluctuations under the influence of elevated current densities is amplified (Fig.6f). This phenomenon may be attributed to an intensified reaction and accelerated rate of ion depletion at higher currents. To accurately quantify the fluctuation ranges of currents and voltages, the range of electrical signals at various current densities was calculated. This has substantiated the exceptionally wide fluctuation range of chaotic currents (Fig.6g, h).',\n",

The voltage/current ratio during actual manganese metal electrodeposition has demonstrated that the increased current efficiency of chaotic currents can be attributed to a reduction of the cell voltage (Fig.7c). The results of the area distribution of manganese nodules calculated using image processing have revealed that CC can achieve a significant suppression of nodules over a wide range of current density variations (Fig. S4a-d). The reduced area ratio of nodules (AR-N) was found to exceed 40%, with a maximum of 48.8% (Fig.7d).',\n",

When the average current under CC was set to 0.508\\xa0A, the CE can be improved by 6.08%, the EC can be lowered by 0.84 kWh/kg, the ratio of voltage to current can be reduced by 0.4, and the area ratio of nodules can be inhibited by 40.5%, which represents the best result reported to date39,40.',\n",

The amplification factor of the output voltage is represented by 14 dB (voltage amplification by 14 times) and 4 dB (4 times). The influence of voltage fluctuation amplitude and the waveform on the electrodeposition process of manganese metal was evaluated at 4 dB and 14 dB with five types of waveforms (period 1, period 2, chaos-a, chaos-b, and DC).',\n",
       "  'The current signals and voltage signals are illustrated in Fig.8a, b, respectively, with a gain of 14 dB. When the gain was 4 dB, the corresponding current and voltage signals are depicted in Fig.8d, e. These results demonstrated that the amplitude of the current and voltage can be modulated by power amplifiers, and the pattern of voltage fluctuation range variation aligns consistently with the current variation. To better compare the fluctuation ranges and correlations of current signals and voltage signals under various types of current excitations, the reconstructed phase space of the signals was plotted with the current signals taken as the abscissa and the voltage signals as the ordinate (Fig.8c, f). The impact of the electrical signal waveform on the final output working current is significant. It can be concluded that chaotic signals result in greater current fluctuations, while the fluctuation range of periodic current is smaller. This response provides an additional rationale for the greater efficiency of CC in the electrodeposition of manganese when compared with DC.',\n",

It is clear that, under constant direct current (DC) mode, the fluctuation range of the current signal remains below 0.01\\xa0A during electrodeposition (Fig.9a). Conversely, when a chaotic current is employed, the current fluctuation range can extend to 0.25\\xa0A, with a corresponding voltage fluctuation of 2.03\\xa0V (Fig.9a, b). Significantly, this fluctuation range can be finely tuned by adjusting the gain factor of the power amplifier. The influence of the voltage fluctuation amplitude on CE is greater than the impact of the waveform (Fig.9c, and Fig. S5c). A wider voltage fluctuation range is more conducive to manganese electrodeposition. On the other hand, a chaotic waveform with a more complex structure can result in a larger fluctuation range of the output current, which improves CE relative to a periodic electrical signal. The energy consumption should consider both current efficiency and cell voltage, where the chaotic electrical signal with a large fluctuation range demonstrates the most favorable effect (Fig.9c-e, and Fig. S5d, e). The value of reduced EC can reach 0.58 kWh/kg compared with DC electrolysis.',\n",

       " 'paper_27.html': ['Atmospheric pressure plasma jet (APPJ) refers to a category of devices that generate gas discharge plasma in open environment through non-sealed electrodes (Winter et al.2015). APPJ can produce plasma with multiple effects, such as strong electric field, radiation, and reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (RONS). It has been widely used in fields like bio-medicine (Woedtke et al.2013; Cheng et al.2020), material processing (Xu et al.2021; Dou et al.2018; Ouyang et al.2017) and airflow control (Park et al.2021). Owing to the simple construction and flexible control, the practical application and the commercial potential of APPJs have attracted a lot of attention. Extensive researches on APPJs have been conducted, including fundamental understanding of plasma and exploration of its application (Viegas et al.2022).',\n",
       "  'Development of APPJs spans over 50\\xa0years. In 1957, Gianinni et al. first developed a thermal plasma jet devices (Giannini1957). Over the following decades, fundamental research on these thermal plasma jets with temperatures exceeding 10,000\\xa0K was conducted. However, these thermal plasma jets were primarily used as a heat source (e.g., for welding applications) without fully utilizing its plasma characteristics (Akatsuka and Suzuki1993). In 2006, Hong et al. (2006) introduced an insulating dielectric between the electrodes of the jet device and found that the discharge was safe to human skin. In 2008, Lu et al. (2008a) coated a needle electrode with an insulating dielectric to form a single needle electrode APPJ. In 2010, Wu et al. (2010) developed an APPJ device based on positive corona discharge under air condition. Since then, devices combining needle electrodes, ring electrodes, and dielectrics have become mainstream, that is, what we call APPJs today. After that, researchers carried out a series of experiments and simulation studies on the basic characteristics of APPJs (Lu and Laroussi2006; Naidis2011; Walsh et al.2010). Gradually, characteristics of APPJ in practical application scenarios were focused to obtain better processing results.',\n",
       "  'In practical applications of APPJs, interaction with “surfaces” is a common occurrence. For instance, in applications of sterilization, APPJ plume necessarily comes into contact with surfaces harboring viruses and bacteria. The sterilization effect of APPJs largely depends on the interaction between the plasma and the surfaces. Additionally, APPJs can functionalize material surfaces by plasma, altering properties, such as hydrophilicity or hydrophobicity, enhancing surface dielectric strength, and improving redox reaction capabilities. Effects of these application scenarios are connected to the discharge characteristics in APPJ plume. The discharge in APPJ determined the fluxes of energy and reactive species, and thus determined the treatment effects. Bulk ionization in the gas above the surface will also influence the surface discharge and charging. Then treatment area and uniformity will be affected (Xu et al.2021). Meanwhile, discharge of APPJs shows a sensitivity of target properties. In surface geometry, the distance between surface and APPJs can affect the electric field distribution in the gas. Surface electrical properties decide the electrical parameters of surface in the current circuit. Therefore, the discharge current in the APPJ will also be influenced (Bornholdt et al.2010; Sakiyama et al.2008). It can be seen these two aspects formed a complex interplay: on the one hand, the plasma produced by APPJs modifies the properties of the target surface through electric fields, radiation, and RONS; on the other hand, the obstruction by the target surface alters the flow field distribution of the APPJs, with the surface geometry and electrical characteristics affecting the electric field distribution. Moreover, chemical species produced by surface chemical processes can return to the gas phase, influencing the physicochemical properties of the plasma region.',\n",
       "  'This interaction presents new challenges for the practical application of APPJ. Treatment effects by APPJs may be different for different goals, meaning that most application scenarios cannot be covered by a single form of APPJs. However, the flexibility of APPJ makes it possible to optimize the effect of surface treatment by adjusting a variety of parameters. For better treatment effects, researchers have conducted a lot of parameter discussions, including types of excitation sources, input power, APPJ structure, surface electrical properties, surface distance from APPJ, etc. (Norberg et al.2019; Lietz and Kushner2018; Zhang et al.2017a). These parameter sets form the basic understanding of interaction between APPJs and surface. Of course, in the course of these discussions, a huge amount of literature was produced. It is difficult to get the full picture of APPJ interactions with surfaces just by reading a few of these papers. Considering this is a relatively new topic, we aim to further understand the issue of APPJs surface treatment by reviewing recent research. Through our summary, we hope to provide readers with a comprehensive understanding of the topic of APPJ–surface interaction.',\n",
       "  'This paper will be structured around three topics: a review of APPJs, kinetics of APPJ–surface interactions, and the practical application of APPJs surface treatment as shown in Fig.1. In Sect.2, we will first summarize parameter characteristics of APPJs, elaborate on the research progress. In Sect.2.4, the impact of surface properties on APPJs will be introduced. We will then discuss the kinetics of APPJ surface treatment. This part will be divided into 2 aspects: bulk processes and surface processes. Discussion in bulk processes will focus on the plasma dynamics in the space above the surface, like ionization waves, gas heating, and flow control. While the surface processes part will introduce the physical and chemical processes happening on the target surface. These two parts are not isolated from each other, but are interrelated and influence each other. Finally, based on actual application scenarios, this paper will review the practical application research of APPJs in the fields of material processing and bio-medicine in Sect.4. Although the application of APPJs is not limited to these two fields, considering the paper topic of APPJs surface treatment, material processing, and bio-medicine are the earliest, most deeply researched, and closest to practical application scenarios among all the application field of APPJs. Furthermore, in these 2 fields, the application of APPJs typically involves direct action on surfaces, hence the emphasis on these two areas in the review.',\n",

       "  'Generation of plasma jets would be first introduced in this part. Properties of APPJs are sensitive to many parameters (Winter et al.2015), such as electrode configuration, geometric parameters, excitation mode, gas atmosphere, and the characteristics of the surface being treated. Altering these parameters results in different plasma properties. Here, we summarize the discharge mechanism in APPJ devices and the impact of the aforementioned parameters.',\n",
       "  'The electrode configuration significantly influences the electric field distribution in an APPJ device, and thus affects the discharge dynamics. Due to the requirements of gas flow path, electrodes in APPJs are typically configured in needle or ring shapes (Winter et al.2015; Ehlbeck et al.2011) to establish strong electric field in the devices and then generate plasma.',\n",
       "  'Typical electrode configurations of APPJs are shown in Fig.2. Single-needle electrode configuration shown in Fig.2a could generate plasma by building discharge path between the electrode and surface to be treated. Discharge photo of single-needle electrode configuration by Kang et al. (2017) is also shown. Plasma initiated from the corona discharge, thus the discharge on the tip of needle was significant. And then the discharge developed along the tube, forming the SIWs on the tube wall and produced plume outside the tube. This kind of configuration is always driven by DC voltage. Under the constant high voltage, large current may flow through the target surface, leading to the harm of target caused by large current and high temperature. Thus, needle electrodes are often covered by a layer of insulating dielectric to form the dielectric barrier, and the resistors are also introduced into circuit to limit the current. These improvements allow the single-needle electrode configuration to generate plasma jets with low temperature. In 2008, Lu et al. designed a single-electrode jet device, covering the copper electrode with a quartz tube. The current of jet was about 500\\xa0mA under the pulsed DC voltage of 9\\xa0kV, and the rotational temperature (which is believed to be closed to gas temperature in plasma) of plasma plume was about 300\\xa0K (Lu et al.2008b). In 2010, Bussiahn et al. (2010) developed a negative polarity DC-driven APPJ device, introducing a current-limiting resistor of 100Ω. Under the voltage of 10–14\\xa0kV, the measured gas temperature was approximately 304\\u2009±\\u200911\\xa0K, near to the room temperature. In the same year, Wu et al. developed a similar device driven by positive DC voltage, with a resistor of 120 MΩ connecting to the needle electrode. In air environment, the device produced current pulses with an amplitude of about 15\\xa0mA and was touchable for fingers (Wu et al.2010). It can be seen that the dielectric coating on electrode serves to limit the current (Brandenburg2017; Kogelschatz2003), but the treated substrate typically remains at a floating potential and is still part of the current path, which is not safe and stable in application.',\n",

       "  'By adding an annular ground electrode outside the tube, the needle-ring electrode structure shown in Fig.2b is built. Unlike the single-needle structure, discharge in the needle-ring electrode structure primarily occurred between the electrodes. The electric field formed by the high voltage causes radial transport of electrons within the tube, making it difficult for electrons to undergo axial transport to the downstream region. Consequently, the discharge plume formed by the needle-ring electrode structure has a shortened length but a significantly increased plume radius (Walsh and Kong2008). Kim et al. showed that current amplitude of jet slightly increased after introducing ring electrode, and higher densities of reactive species, such as O, N, and OH, are produced downstream (Kim et al.2009a). Simulation work by Van Gaens et al. (2014) also indicated that ground ring electrode increased the density of reactive species. On the other hand, the introduction of ring electrode also causes the discharge current to flow through the space between the two electrodes. Another study by Kim et al. revealed that after the introduction of the ground electrode, the light intensity of plasma between the needle and ring electrodes significantly increased, stronger than the light intensity of plume region, suggesting that more current flows through the ring electrode. As a result, the current flowing through the human body during treatment is reduced, making it safer for bio-medicine application (Kang et al.2017). The discharge photo by Shashurin et al. (2009) shown in Fig.2b also verified this conclusion.The single-ring electrode structure in Fig.2c can generate plasma inside the tube, similar to the principle of dielectric barrier discharge (Lu et al.2012). In 2002, Hubicka et al. developed a single-ring electrode APPJ driven by RF power supply. They indicated that the discharge current inside the tube was suppressed due to the barrier effect of the dielectric tube, preventing the discharge from transitioning to a high-temperature arc (Hubicka et al.2002). Walsh et al. compared the discharge by needle-ring electrode configuration (cross-field) and single-ring electrode configuration (linear field). Results showed that single-ring jet could drive electron transportation to the downstream application region, thus facilitating more active plasma chemistry near the target than the needle-ring electrode (Walsh and Kong2008). Photo taken by Hao et al. (2014a) shown in Fig.2c also showed significant brightness between ring electrode and the target, indicating strong discharge downstream. This strong discharge would improve the surface treatment effect, while increasing the risk in biomedical treatments at the same time. In addition, the discharge would develop upstream from the electrode, indicating the risk of reverse breakdown in the tube.',\n",
       "  'Adding one or more grounded ring into the device can form the double-ring or the multi-ring electrode structure shown in Fig.2d. The discharge primarily occurs in the area between the ring electrodes shown in the photo by Puac et al. (2012) in Fig.2d, also limiting the current flowing through the treated biological or material object. The upstream discharge is also weaker in Fig.2d than Fig.2c. The main discharge mechanism involves charge overflow and the corona discharge by ring electrode. In the charge overflow mechanism, discharge mainly happens between the two electrodes inside the tube, followed by the migration of charged species and electric fields downstream under the gas flow. Sometimes the discharge is mainly caused by the corona discharge of ring electrode close to the tube orifice. Zhang et al. studied the influence of the distance between the high voltage ring electrode and the grounding ring electrode on the discharge mechanism in Ar–APPJs. The results showed that when the distance between the double ring electrodes was small, the APPJ primarily included DBD and charge overflow. But when the distance increased to a certain extent, corona discharge also occurred inside the tube (Zhang et al.2017b). Discharge mechanism was also relevant to the potential of ring electrodes. Results by Shao et al. indicated that when the ring upstream connected to high voltage, charge overflow was the main mechanism of discharge, and corona discharge of downstream ring would be the main mechanism if high voltage was connected to the downstream ring (Shao et al.2012). The connection way was relevant to the gas type, which will be introduced in detail in Sect.2.3.1.',\n",
       "  'Micro-hollow cathode discharge (MHCD), with the structure shown in Fig.2e, can also produce stable plasma jet. This structure was first raised by Schoenbach et al. (1996) to reduce or even eliminate instability developing in the cathode fall. They found MHCD could generate stable discharge in air, and would not transition into an arc under high DC voltage, by confining the glow discharge in a hollow cathode geometry with dimensions on the order of 1\\xa0mm (Stark and Schoenbach1999). Thus, MHCD was widely used to generate air–APPJ. Hong et al. investigated the micro-plasma jet produced by MHCD in air, with a hole of 1\\xa0mm diameter. The air plasma jet device at average powers less than 5 W exhibits a cold plasma jet of about 2\\xa0cm in length and near the room temperature, being low enough to treat thermally sensitive materials (Hong and Uhm2007). Kolb et al. reported an air plasma jet driven by a high voltage (HV) direct current (DC) power supply. A discharge channel through an insulator with a thickness of about 0.2–0.5\\xa0mm and a diameter of 0.2–0.8\\xa0mm separated anode and cathode. This device was able to generate a 2\\xa0cm long plasma jet (Kolb et al.2008). Hao et al. (2014b) diagnosed the types of reactive species generated by a plasma jet in a microhollow cathode discharge geometry when operated with air and a DC voltage, finding that NO is the dominant long-lived reaction product, while the concentrations observed for NO2and O3are negligible. Duan et al. (2021) studied the influences of the gas flow rate on the He plasma jet produced by MHCD, finding that with the helium flow rate increasing, the whole plasma jet length increases first and then decreases. It can be seen that the diameter of these plasma jet based on MHCD is almost little than 1\\xa0mm, which ensures the stability of plasma jet. But little geometric size also limits the application of MHCD in treatment for large areas.',\n",
       "  'The structures described above encompass the common APPJs found in current research. Based on the above structure, a large number of researchers have conducted parametric studies on electrode shape and device geometry (Yue et al.2016a; Wang et al.2022,2021). However, APPJs above are generally single-tube jets, with the diameter of the dielectric tube typically in the mm range, and the processing area is limited in 1 cm2(Ghasemi et al.2013). Additionally, studies have shown that under thicker tube diameters, the plasma produced by He–APPJs is primarily generated at the interface between He and air, with the plasma density being lower along the central axis of the tube, which is extremely disadvantageous for surface treatment (Lu et al.2014). To address the limited processing range of single-tube APPJs, researchers have proposed the formation of APPJ arrays, which achieve a multiplication of the processing area through the parallel connection of multiple single-tube APPJs. Some common APPJ array devices are shown in Fig.3. According to the principle of discharge generation, APPJ arrays can be categorized into two types: the first is called separate discharge form as shown in Fig.3a for 1D arrays (Wang et al.2019,2017; Pei et al.2011; Zhou et al.2018; Zhang et al.2014a) and Fig.3b for 2D arrays (Hu et al.2012; Kim et al.2012a,2012b; Fang et al.2016; Nie et al.2009). The discharge is generated in different dielectric tubes and then the dielectric tubes are arranged in a certain manner to multiply the APPJ processing area. The second is referred to as unified discharge form. As shown in Fig.3c, discharge is generated in the same space and then the jet outlets are arranged in a certain pattern to extend the processing area.',\n",
       "  'Common APPJ arrays:a1D array (Wang et al.2019);b2D array (Kim et al.2012a);cunified discharge form (Robert et al.2015)',\n",
       "  'The separate discharge form achieves a multiplication of the APPJ processing area, overcoming the contradiction between surface treatment and the diameter of the dielectric tube mentioned earlier. However, experimental results indicate that there are complex interactions between the individual single-tube APPJs in the separate discharge array device. Ghasemi et al. (2013) found that the discharge in the APPJ array significantly shortened the laminar flow region, leading to mutual exclusion between the plumes of each APPJ and causing uneven treatment effect. Additionally, Babaeva et al. indicated that the He gas flows emitted from multiple dielectric tubes would merge downstream, concentrating more He under the central dielectric tube while the mole fraction of He on the sides are smaller, resulting in the ionization waves generated by APPJ units on both sides meeting air faster and quenching during the propulsion process. This inhibition effect would lead to the situation that the discharge in one or more tubes might be suppressed (Babaeva and Kushner2014; Babaeva et al.2018). Fang et al. (2016) and Kim et al. (2012b) also observed that the discharge of the central tube in the 2D array device significantly increased at low flow rates, while the discharge of the surrounding APPJ units weakened. Despite various measures to improve the uniformity of discharge by APPJ arrays, such as modifying the arrangement of needle electrodes(Wang et al.2019), increasing flow rates (Wang et al.2017; Fang et al.2016), adjusting pulse frequencies (Wang et al.2017), and mixing O2in the working gas (Zhang et al.2014a), the issue of uneven downstream processing becomes more pronounced for larger-scale APPJs. In the unified discharge form, the structure shown in Fig.3c also generates discharge in a fine tube and then ejects it, overcoming the contradiction between discharge size and loss, and can develop into more flexible and versatile flexible APPJs (Robert et al.2015; Wang et al.2024a). However, this type of device also has significant issues, such as the need for a certain diffusion distance after discharge generation before reaching the jet nozzle, resulting in significant loss of reactive species during the longer diffusion distance. Thus, its processing efficiency is clearly low. Moreover, due to the different distance between the nozzle and the discharge location, the issue of uneven treatment effects remains significant (Lietz et al.2019).',\n",
       "  'Overall, discharge of APPJs is highly sensitive to the device structure. However, many researches have analyzed the impact of electrode configurations, geometric structure, and other factors on APPJs performance. Based on the understanding of APPJs, optimal device structure can be designed for specific application scenarios. The increasing focus on APPJ arrays reflects researchers’ attention to the industrial application of APPJs. The further aim in the APPJ array design is to reduce losses and improve processing uniformity.',\n",
       "  'The form of the power supply driving APPJs significantly influences the discharge produced by the APPJs. The commonly used power supply forms include DC, AC, RF, microwave (MW), and pulsed DC. In this section, we will discuss these excitation sources from the aspects of discharge waveform and mechanism. DC, AC, and pulsed DC are believed to induce discharge in APPJ with similar mechanism, and thus their similarities and differences will be introduced in 2.2.1. RF and MW power supplies share similar sine waveform to AC, but the frequency is significantly different. Compared to AC power supplies, which operate in the kHz range, RF power supplies operate in the MHz range, and MW power supplies operate in the GHz range. Differences of frequency cause different discharge mechanism, and thus different device configurations are needed, which will be discussed in 2.2.2 and 2.2.3 respectively. Also, specific waveforms can also be obtained by modulating excitation sources for different application scenarios, which will profoundly affect the characteristics of APPJ. This part will be introduced in Sect.2.2.4.',\n",
       "  'The typical voltage and the current waveforms of DC-driven APPJs are shown in Fig.\\xa04a1, a2. In DC-driven APPJs, needle electrode configurations and MHCD devices are mostly used. In these jets, DC sources apply constant voltage, but the discharge current would present 2 different modes: “self-pulsing” mode and stable discharge mode (“true” DC mode called by Pei et al. (2018). Self-pulsing mode presents transient current pulse waveforms. The current pulses with the amplitude of several mA will also cause the decrease of discharge voltage, leading to the oscillations of the voltage and current as shown in Fig.\\xa04a1, which was observed by Deng et al. (2013). In needle configurations APPJs, corona discharge is the main reason leading to current pulses as exemplified by the APPJs developed by Wu et al. (2010), and Bussiahn et al. (2010). Periodic current pulses have also been observed in the corona discharge of the needle-plate electrode. Janda et al. (2012) observed the self-pulsing in the needle-plane configuration, and suggested that transient spark mechanism was the main mechanism, i.e. filamentary streamer-to-spark transition initiated by a streamer. Under special conditions, discharge in needle electrode configurations would change to “true” DC mode, in which the current amplitude is also close to a constant value. Deng et al. (2013) found that in needle-mesh electrode air or N2plasma jet, a stable glow discharge would happen as shown in Fig.\\xa04a2 when the discharge current was higher than 10\\xa0mA. But we need to point out that their needle-mesh electrode configuration is a special configuration in APPJs. The discharge happening between needle and mesh electrodes is similar to the discharge happening in needle-plane electrode, and the reactive species is carried by the air flow and diffused downstream in this kind of jets. In common single needle and needle-ring electrode jets, self-pulsing mode caused by corona discharge is the normal state. As for MHCD configurations, self-pulsing mode and “true” DC mode are both common under different voltage and gas flow conditions. The transition of these 2 modes is considered as the change of discharge from unstable state to stable state, and thus the alteration between 2 modes is described as the “stability” questions by Hsu et al. (2003). They verified that the self-pulsing mode of MHCD occurred only if the load line crossed the discharge characteristic in the region of negative differential resistivity. Aubert et al. and also Boeuf et al. suggested that the self-pulsing is related to the periodic transition between the expansion of the plasma outside the cathode hole and the plasma inside the cathode hole (Boeuf et al.2005; Aubert et al.2007; Rousseau and Aubert2006). But Pei et al. found that the discharge characteristics MHCD jets in self-pulsing mode were similar to the transient spark mechanism. The “memory” effects, i.e. very high repetition frequencies due to pre-heating and accumulation of various species created by preceding discharge events, were observed in experiments by Pei et al. (2018). Repitition frequency of about kHz in self-pulsing mode is also consistent with transient spark mechanism. Under specific gas flow and voltage, the discharge in MHCD jets would transition to stable “true” DC mode, which is mainly the glow discharge. However, the rotation temperature in “true” DC mode of MHCD can be higher than 1000\\xa0K (Pei et al.2018; Deng et al.2013), which is not suitable for biomedical treatment at all. Thus, self-pulsing mode is expected for the surface treatment acquiring low temperature in the studies of APPJs with MHCD configurations.',\n",
       "  'The characteristics of DC-driven APPJs can be summarized as follows: (1) They have a simple structure and low requirements for power supply waveforms, allowing for the manufacture of more portable devices, like “plasma flashlight” by Pei et al. (2012). (2) The DC voltage maintains a high amplitude, which poses a significant risk of high current. Therefore, DC-driven APPJs often require the addition of an extra current-limiting resistor. For example, Wu et al.’s device has a 130 MΩ resistor in series at the DC power supply outlet, producing a current pulse peak of about 17\\xa0mA (2010). (3) The current-limiting resistor enhances the safety of the DC-driven APPJ but also increases power consumption. In Wu et al.’s single-electrode air APPJ, power consumption at the resistor is 0.3 W, while power consumption at the plasma is 0.1 W (Wu et al.2010). In Kolb et al.’ (2008) s dual-electrode APPJ device, power consumption at the resistor is 20 W while power consumption at the plasma is less than 10W.',\n",
       "  'AC-driven APPJs are the most commonly used power source in experiments due to the ease of generating this waveform through simple frequency and voltage tuning of AC electricity. The typical voltage–current waveform of AC-driven He–APPJ with single-ring electrode structure by Walsh et al. is shown in Fig.4b (Walsh et al.2008). It can be seen that the current waveform is the superposition of a sine wave and multi-pulsed discharge waveform, which is similar to the current waveform in parallel-plate DBD. Discharge current presented positive and negative pulses in positive and negative cycle respectively. Similar waveforms were also observed by Sobota et al. (hollow needle and ring electrode He–APPJ), Ning et al. (double-ring electrode He–APPJ), Shao et al. (double-ring electrode He and Ar–APPJ), indicating that this kind of waveform was the commonality of AC-driven APPJ (Sobota et al.2014; Ning et al.2014a, Shao et al.2012). The sine waveform of current exhibited a clear capacitive characteristic, and the equivalent circuit of an AC-driven APPJ device often includes a large number of capacitive components, containing gas capacitance, stray capacitance, and the dielectric capacitance (Huang et al.2022; Judée and Dufour2019). Current pulses represented the transient discharge happening in the gas, which would be different when the conditions like the gas atmosphere or applied voltage were changed. For example, Sobota et al. found that the discharge pulses under low power input had great repeatability, showing narrow, strong pulses in positive half and weak, broadened pulses in negative half. This waveform was easily observed in He–APPJ with low power input, which was also presented in the studies by Walsh et al. (Fig.4b) and Ning et al. (2014a). Photos by Shao et al. (2012) indicated that the difference was caused by the different discharge characteristics of plasma plume. In positive half, plasma outside the tube propagated in the ambient air along the helium/air interface, while the plasma in negative half presented as bulk discharge downstream. These repeatable pulses represent the discrete discharge events in APPJ, i.e. so-called “plasma bullets” (Teschke et al.2005), which will be introduced in Sect.3.1. But under high power input, the experimental results by Sobota et al. (2014) showed that the discharge pulses became random and chaotic, indicating the discharge event in the gas also came to random mode. In fact, the plasma bullets also have different modes with the increase of voltage (Walsh et al.2010), which is consistent with the difference discussed above.',\n",

       "  \"The advancement of plasma diagnostic techniques has also led to more researchers focusing on the discharge plasma characteristics of AC-driven APPJs. Measurement results by Shashurin et al. (2010) and Lu et al. (2013) indicate an electron density of about 1013cm−3. Feidhlim et al. studied APPJ discharge within the frequency range of 20–140\\xa0kHz, and infrared temperature measurement images showed that the temperature inside the APPJ device driven by kHz frequency AC power is generally around 40\\xa0℃. The discharge frequency affects the coupling efficiency of the device, further impacting gas heating and the production of reactive species (O'Neill et al.2012). Overall, APPJs driven by kHz-level AC power sources generally have a discharge power of 1–10 W, an electron density in the order of 1013cm−3, and the gas temperature is close to room temperature.\",\n",
       "  'In recent years, APPJs driven by pulsed voltage have gained widespread attention, especially in the field of bio-medicine. The rapid voltage rise allows electrons to acquire high energy in a short time, making it easier for electrons to ionize background gas molecules or atoms rather than being consumed in low-energy molecular vibrational or rotational states. This results in relatively low gas temperatures in pulsed discharge. More energy accumulates in the electrons, facilitating the generation of more intense reactions and higher densities of reactive species. Additionally, pulsed power supplies can generate stronger electric fields and control the timing of plasma generation and its chemical and physical reactions. Therefore, pulsed power is considered as an ideal source to generate non-equilibrium plasma (Zhang et al.2015).',\n",
       "  'Typical discharge waveforms of APPJs driven by pulsed DC are illustrated in Fig.4c, obtained by Walsh et al. (2008) using a He–APPJ device with a single-ring electrode structure. The discharge happened in the rising and falling edges of pulses, presenting as positive current pulse and negative current pulse respectively. Peak current is 12.1\\xa0mA in the voltage-rising phase and 12.9\\xa0mA in the voltage-falling phase. The difference in the peak discharge current is insignificant, suggesting that the time scale of the voltage variation, 30\\xa0μs and 100\\xa0ns, was unlikely to be the only influencing factor. The pattern of the discharge current was highly periodic with the peak current being the same from one voltage pulse to another. Similar waveform was also observed by Lu et al. In their experiment, voltage amplitude of 9\\xa0kV, pulse width of 1\\xa0μs, and pulse repetition frequency of 10\\xa0kHz were applied. Discharge events occurred at both the rising and falling edges of the pulse in the pulsed DC-driven APPJ device, corresponding to the generation of positive and negative discharge currents. The measured discharge current amplitude was about 400\\xa0mA, and the calculated discharge power was approximately 1 W based on the voltage and current waveforms, indicating the low energy consumption and high efficiency of pulsed DC-driven APPJs. Their results also indicated that the gas vibration temperature is approximately 300\\xa0K, and the rotational temperature was 2950\\xa0K, demonstrating significant non-equilibrium characteristics (Lu et al.2008b). In fact, there may not be only 2 current pulses during one voltage pulse. During the rising or falling edge of the pulse, the discharge tends to occur multiple times, showing in the experimental results by Liu et al. (2022). These multiple discharge pulses are connected with the gas atmosphere and electrode structure. Even so, the discharge only happens at the rising or falling edge of voltage pulses. Moreover, pulsed DC waveforms are highly adjustable, with parameters such as pulse width (Zhang et al.2014b), pulse amplitude (Zhang et al.2015; Jarrige et al.2010), repetition frequency (Zhang et al.2015), and voltage polarity (Jiang et al.2023a) all proven to significantly alter plasma characteristics, indicating the flexibility of pulsed DC-driven APPJs for different application scenarios. Pulsed DC-driven APPJs exhibit advantages, such as high efficiency, low energy consumption, and low temperature, with strong flexibility and promising application prospects. However, pulsed DC devices require complex modulation circuits and high requirements for waveform control, which necessitates a high cost for the wide range of parameter adjustments, limiting the commercial application of pulsed DC-driven APPJs.',\n",
       "  'In summary, DC-driven APPJs, AC-driven APPJs, and pulsed DC-driven APPJs show similar discrete discharge pulses in current waveforms. However, pulses in DC-driven APPJs are significantly different because the pulses are self-excited with high repeating frequency. The constant voltage amplitude also leads to high power consumption of DC-driven APPJs. Furthermore, high DC voltage tends to induce glow discharge, with high gas temperature and current, which is not suitable in biomedicine application but would be beneficial for chemical engineering requiring high treatment efficiency. As for AC-driven APPJs and pulsed DC-driven APPJs, transient discharge pulses can be controlled by the voltage waveforms because they only happen at specific voltage phase with short duration. High controllability and low energy consumption make these two sources get more attention. But the difference between these two excitation sources is also significant. Xiong et al. compared the discharge phenomena of AC and pulsed DC-driven APPJs using the same He–APPJ device, finding that the pulsed DC-driven APPJ achieved a longer plume length and a temperature closer to room temperature compared to the AC-driven APPJ. Additionally, the pulsed DC-driven APPJ consumed 1.8 W of power, while the AC-driven APPJ consumed 3.5 W (Xiong et al.2010a). Walsh et al. compared AC and pulsed-driven APPJs based on reactive species, and the results showed that the AC power-driven APPJ consumed 12 times more energy than the pulsed-driven APPJ to produce the same density of O (Walsh and Kong2008). These studies fully demonstrate that pulsed DC-driven APPJs can produce high-density reactive species under low energy consumption, proving the high efficiency of pulsed DC-driven APPJs. But the high design and manufacturing cost of pulse source are its significant disadvantages.',\n",
       "  'RF sources with the frequency of MHz have been used to generate plasma for many years (Yang et al.2005). It has been verified that a stable, capacitive discharge can be produced at atmospheric pressure by feeding helium or argon between two metal electrodes driven with RF power at 13.56\\xa0MHz (Moravej et al.2004), and thus APPJs driven by RF sources have also been produced (Jeong et al.1999a,b; Zhu et al.2005). APPJs driven by 13.56\\xa0MHz RF power are capacitively coupled plasma, producing stable and homogeneous discharge. The gas temperature of the discharge is typically between 25 and 200\\xa0˚C, and thus thermal damage to the substrate is reduced or even eliminated. The discharge uses a feed gas consisting of rare gas and a small fraction of reactive gases (e.g. O2, CF4or H2O) (Zhu et al.2005).',\n",
       "  'One important problem of RF-driven discharge is the operation mode. Raizer et al. indicated that the discharge driven by RF sources had 2 kinds of modes: α mode and γ mode, depending on the dominant ionization process (Yang et al.2005). In α mode, plasma is sustained by bulk ionization, while in γ mode, it is sustained by secondary electron emission from the electrode surface. It is once believed that the discharge needs to work in alpha mode, otherwise it will be transformed into a high-temperature arc, which is unfavorable for application. But Shi et al. verified that if the current density is restricted appropriately RF discharge can be operated in their γ mode safely without the danger of evolving into arc (Shi and Kong2005).',\n",
       "  'RF (radiofrequency)-driven APPJs are mostly generated between two parallel plate electrodes or coaxial cylindrical electrodes, and then charged species in the diffuse discharge would be blown out by gas flow to form plume downstream. For example, Jeong et al. developed an APPJ device without dielectric, with a high-voltage electrode at the center of the grounded metal tube connected to a RF power source, with a frequency of 13.56\\xa0MHz. The RF input power range is 50–500 W, and when flowing a mixture of He/O2at a flow rate of 5 slm, stable discharge can be produced outside the nozzle, with gas temperatures of about 100–275\\xa0℃ (Jeong et al.1999a). RF-driven APPJs studied by Laimer et al. also use a parallel plate electrode structure, with discharge occurring between the parallel RF metal electrodes and the grounded metal electrodes, then ejected under the action of the gas flow, showing a typical diffuse discharge mode and operating in the α mode (Laimer and Störi2006; Laimer et al.2007). kINPens, produced by INP company, used a traditional needle-ring electrode structure with the frequency of about 1\\xa0MHz to generate plasma jet, achieving capacitive coupling through a dielectric tube. The power consumption in the plasma was about 0.3–0.5 W, voltage amplitude range was 2–6\\xa0kV, and total power consumption was about 20 W. When flowing 5 slm argon, the gas temperature in the plasma region was about 48 ℃ (Reuter et al.2018).',\n",
       "  'Researchers have also extensively measured the plasma and gas temperature parameters of RF-driven APPJs. In experiments by Zhu et al. (2005) the temperature between the electrodes in a 13.56\\xa0MHz RF-driven APPJ device was about 50–150\\xa0℃. Qian et al. and Hofmann et al. experimentally diagnosed RF-driven APPJ discharge, indicating that the electron density produced is about 1013cm−3to 1014cm−3, and the gas temperature depended on the type of working gas, ranging 300–650\\xa0K. The overall power consumption of the device was about 20 W, with power consumption in the plasma depending on the current size, usually less than 10 W (Qian et al.2010; Hofmann et al.2011). Thus, RF-driven APPJs generally have a power consumption in the tens of W range, with power coupled to the plasma region of 1–10 W, and the discharge area temperature is generally above room temperature, with an electron density of 1013cm−3to 1014cm−3.',\n",
       "  'Compared to kHz AC-driven APPJs, higher frequency of RF-driven APPJs changes the discharge mechanism and thus a series of characteristics are also different. Kim et al. compared the difference between single-needle electrodes He–APPJ driven by 50\\xa0kHz and 13.56\\xa0MHz voltage. Their results showed that AC plasma plume was ten times longer than RF plasma. And the discharge characteristics were more continuous in RF plasma jet as seen from the current and plasma emission measurements because diffuse discharge in RF APPJs was more continuous than corona discharge in AC APPJ. The continuity in the waveform was related to the plasma homogeneity; thus, RF APPJ might have better homogeneity. In addition, gas temperature of AC APPJ was as low as the room temperature while the temperature of RF APPJ was always higher than room temperature. Finally, the plasma emission spectrum of the RF plasma had much higher intensity and more helium atomic emission lines indicating larger plasma density and/or electron temperature (Kim et al.2007). In summary, RF-driven APPJs can obtain uniform processing effects. But high gas temperature and risk of transitioning to arc demand strict control strategy of RF sources. Some applications requiring high gas temperature may also be suitable to use RF-driven APPJs.',\n",
       "  'Microwave (MW) frequency-driven APPJs employ a distinct discharge mechanism and device structure. During the discharge plasma generation process, MW power sources can operate without the use of electrodes. Instead, microwave energy is transmitted through coaxial cables and waveguides, with the design of a resonant cavity to concentrate energy at a resonant point and induce discharge. The key to these devices lies in the design of the resonant cavity and the reduction of wave conduction losses, which often leads to complex structures and high precision requirements. MW-driven APPJs designed by Kim et al. (2008) and Fu et al. (2019a) are more representative. Kim et al. designed a flat-plate device with an internal hollow alumina dielectric as the main body, leaving square gas channels on both sides of the alumina plate, and a flat nozzle. Microwave energy was introduced into the device through an SMA connector, with a microstrip line connected to the SMA covering the dielectric plate, transmitting microwave energy to the interior. The device was grounded at the bottom, with matching impedance connected to the microstrip line to achieve impedance matching. The device operated at a frequency of 2.45\\xa0GHz, and the measured gas rotational temperature was 1720–900\\xa0K when Ar flow rate was 0.5–3.5 slm (Kim et al.2008). Fu et al. designed a MW-driven low-temperature APPJ device with two layers of coaxial cables, with the outer cable connected to the microwave source, producing energy coupling between the inner and outer cables to induce discharge plasma. Infrared measurements indicate that the nozzle temperature was approximately 75\\xa0℃, and the temperature of human skin was about 60\\xa0°C. As power increased, the gas temperature in the discharge region rose to about 240\\xa0℃ (Fu et al.2019a). Jasinski et al. conducted comprehensive diagnostics on MW-driven discharge plasma characteristics, indicating an electron temperature of up to 2\\u2009×\\u2009104K and an electron density of about 1015cm−3 (Jasinski et al.2002).',\n",
       "  'It can be seen that the gas temperature is much higher than room temperature, and the power consumption is also very significant in MW-driven APPJs. There have also been some attempts at miniaturization and biological applications of the MW-driven APPJs. An integrated microwave plasma source was investigated by Bussiahn et al. (2012). A solid-state transistor oscillator at 2.45\\xa0GHz is used in their device, and power of the microwave generator is about 10W. In Ar atmosphere, this MW plasma torches produces biological tolerable gas temperatures below 35 ℃ at an axial distance of 5\\xa0mm from the outlet. Judée et al. (2014) also presented results on bactericidal effects of a MW-driven Ar plasma jet. The plasma is ignited within a quartz capillary by means of microwave power of about 40 W at a frequency of 2.45\\xa0GHz. The Ar gas flow rate of 1 slm and the plasma plume are cooled by a compressed air gas flow rate of 22 slm injected into the hull of the device. By comparing antimicrobial results ofEscherichia coliwild type strains with UV-C sensitive mutants, it is concluded that the high energetic UV-C radiation is one of the dominant inactivation factors for this plasma source. Plasma-generated hydrogen peroxide was identified as another factor to participate in the inactivation process.',\n",
       "  'In general, most of MW-driven APPJs are unsuitable for biological object treatment due to their pronounced gas heating effect, strong energy, complex structure, and large volume. But in material processing, pollution treatment, and metallurgical processes, MW-driven APPJs may be more beneficial than other sources. Our discussion will mainly focus on the surface treatment applications, and thus MW-driven APPJs would not be introduced clearly here. For more information of MW-driven APPJs, review papers by Rath et al. (2024) and Winter et al. (2015) are recommended.',\n",
       "  'Plasma characteristics of APPJs excited by different power sources can be significantly different. In order to give full play to the advantages of different excitation sources and minimize their disadvantages, researchers chose to change the plasma characteristics of APPJ by some external modulation methods. There are 2 typical modulating ways: (1) external electric or magnetic field; (2) waveform tailoring of excitation sources.',\n",
       "  'External electric and magnetic field can significantly influence many processes in plasma plume, such as ionization, excitation, and motivation of charged species (Liu et al.2024a). Mechanism and control methods of external fields have been thoroughly studied. Walsh et al. demonstrated that applying voltage pulses of varying duration and delay to supplementary electrodes placed along the axis of propagation could control velocity, intensity, and direction of the ionization waves in the tube. Thus, the flux of reactive species transported to a specific point on a downstream substrate could be electrically modulated on a pulse to pulse basis (Walsh et al.2012). Naidis et al. studied the effects of external electric field driven by voltage pulses through a 1.5D fluid model. Results showed that positive voltage pulse applying on external electrode reduced the velocity of propagation of the cathode-directed streamer, while negative voltage pulse increased the propagation velocity. Furthermore, electric field driven by high positive voltage inhibited propagation and resulted in a significant decrease in the emission intensity (Naidis and Walsh2013). Zhu et al. compared the influences of external transverse electric and magnetic field in their experiments. In electric field, the plasma plume showed behavior of deflection, broadening, and shortening according to the structure of electric field. In magnetic field, the jet deflects to up or down depending on the magnetic direction (Zhu et al.2017). Experimental and numerical results by Barman et al. found that transverse magnetic field would change electron density and electron excitation temperature of APPJs. Densities of some RONS like OH, NO, and N2+would also be changed with the increase of magnetic field. These results might be connected to the Lorentz force and Zeeman effects by transverse magnetic field (Barman et al.2021).',\n",
       "  'Researchers can also adjust the characteristics of the plasma by applying voltage of different frequencies at the same time, which is called voltage waveform tailoring (VWT). By adjusting the relative amplitude and the phase shift between each harmonic, one can generate the peak-, valley- or sawtooth-type of waveform to control the spatial and temporal electron power absorption, and to improve the plasma radial uniformity as well(Liu et al.2021a). Zhou et al. studied Ar–APPJ generated by dual sinusoidal wave (50\\xa0kHz and 2\\xa0MHz). The plasma jet exhibited the advantages of both AC (50\\xa0kHz) and RF (2\\xa0MHz) plasmas, namely the long plasma plume and the high electron density. Lower ignition voltage and larger controllable range of the gas temperature of APPJ could also be obtained using dual-frequency excitation (Zhou et al.2013). Korolov et al. simulated a COST microplasm reference jet operated in He/N2mixtures and driven by tailored voltage waveforms. Their results demonstrate that VWT allowed for the control of the dynamics of energetic electrons, the electron energy distribution function in distinct spatio-temporal regions of interest, and thus, the generation of important RONS such as atomic nitrogen and helium metastables (Korolov et al.2019). Experimental results by Gibson et al. (2019) also demonstrated that tailored voltage waveforms consisting of multiple RF harmonics induced targeted disruption of these symmetries, which confined the electron heating to small regions of time and space and enabled the electron energy distribution function to be tailored. Pinchuk et al. compared the APPJ driven by a sinusoidal voltage waveform with a frequency of 52\\xa0kHz and a voltage waveform that was formed via the superposition of 41.6\\xa0kHz bipolar square pulses and 300\\xa0kHz oscillations. They found that the special tailoring voltage could control the guided streamer propagation. The change of voltage waveform affected the secondary ionization wave formation and streamer parameters, providing the possibility of controlling the plasma parameters of the jet (Pinchuk et al.2019). Liu et al. studied COST microplasma jet driven by tailored voltage waveform using PIC/MCC code. Results showed that tailoring the voltage waveform was able to control the electron energy probability function (EEPF) in distinct spatio-temporal regions of interest. Also, the reactive neutral species can be enhanced by increasing the number of consecutive harmonics (Liu et al.2021a).',\n",
       "  'In summary, external electric field and magnetic field can both influence the characteristics of plasma plume, by changing the shape, length and even the densities of reactive species. Voltage waveform tailoring also offers a method to control the plasma plume of APPJs for specific application scenarios. These modulation technologies show the good controllability of APPJs, and further increase the application scenarios of APPJ.',\n",
       "  'Gas environment is an important part of the APPJs. Due to the different physical and chemical properties of the gas itself, the discharge of APPJs shows different characteristics and mechanisms in different gas environments. This section focuses on the influence of gas environment on APPJs, including the influence of different gas types (including gas mixture), gas flow rate and shielding gas on the generation, development mechanism and discharge phenomena of APPJs.',\n",
       "  'Working gases used in APPJs will influence main characteristics of APPJs, such as ignition voltage, gas temperature, and the types of reactive species. For most of application fields, air will be expected to be the working gas because it offers the environment to generate high density of reactive species, such as OH, O3, NO, etc. Actually there have been many researches that achieve air APPJs (Sun et al.2012; Lu et al.2021) and N2APPJs (Hong and Uhm2006; Chien et al.2018; Ni et al.2008). For instance, air APPJs with needle electrode configurations by Lu et al. shown in Fig.5a and MHCD air/N2APPJs shown in Fig.5b, c are all able to generate plasma plume that can be touched by fingers. But noble gases like He and Ar seem to be studied more in APPJs. On the one hand, rare gases are easily ignited in APPJs rather than air. Although the first ionization energy of He (2372\\xa0kJ/mol) and Ar (1523\\xa0kJ/mol) is higher than N2(1402\\xa0kJ/mol) and O2(1313\\xa0kJ/mol), rare gases are more easily to be excited than air due to the fact that rare gases are all monoatomic gases, lacking molecular vibrational and rotational states. Consequently, electrons consume more energy in collision ionization rather than in molecular vibrational and rotational states, allowing a lower ignition voltage. Furthermore, strong electronegativity of O2causes strong electron adsorption process, leading to the quenching of secondary electrons produced by the discharge, which also makes the discharge in air difficult to realize. On the other hand, gas temperature of air/N2APPJs is always higher than room temperature. When molecular gasses are presented, because of their low rotational and vibrational energy levels, electrons can quickly transfer energy to those states, which further results in the increase in gas temperature (Lu et al.2021). For example, experimental results by Deng et al. show that gas temperature between two electrodes could reach about 4000\\xa0K in air–APPJs (Deng et al.2013). But in most of He/Ar APPJs, gas temperature is very close to room temperature. High gas temperature of APPJs with molecular gases leads to the risk of treating biomedicine or heat-sensitive objects.',\n",

       "  'He is one of the most commonly used working gas, characterized by its small neutron absorption cross section, high specific heat and thermal conductivity, and stable chemical properties. These characteristics make it an ideal working gas for APPJs. Researchers have conducted in-depth experimental observations on the discharge process and morphology within the He–APPJs environment, summarizing the common characteristics of He–APPJs discharge phenomena: (1) It presents a diffuse discharge morphology, which extinguishes at a certain distance outside the dielectric tube nozzle when there is no downstream processing target, with the plume exhibiting a reversed cone shape; (2) Under positive polarity voltage driving, He–APPJs develop in the form of discrete ring-shaped “bullets” into the air, while under negative polarity voltage driving, the discharge in He–APPJs is predominantly diffuse and uniform(Lu et al.2012; Lu2011; Xiong et al.2012). Physical mechanism and properties of plasma “bullet” in He APPJs would be introduced in detail in Sect.3.',\n",
       "  'As another noble gas, Ar is also used in APPJs because of its stable physicochemical properties and low price (Shao et al.2012). Many experiments have also proven the ability to generate stable discharge in Ar (Kim et al.2009b; Iio et al.2011; Srivastava and Wang2011). However, discharge phenomena and mechanisms of Ar and He are significantly different. A typical experimental evidence is that in an APPJ device with a double-ring electrode structure, the He–APPJ can form a stable plume outside the tube when the electrode configuration is grounded upstream and high voltage downstream, while the Ar–APPJ has the opposite electrode configuration for forming the plume, as shown in Fig.5d by Shao et al. (2012). Jiang et al. indicated that there were three discharge regions in a He–APPJ with a double-ring electrode structure: DBD discharge region between the electrodes, discharge area extending from the grounded electrode to the upstream, and discharge area from high voltage electrode to the outside of tube. Among them, the discharge extending from grounded electrode was mainly due to the overflow of charged species, while the discharge generated from high voltage electrode was independent, initiated by corona discharge(Jiang et al.2010; Xiong et al.2010b). Shao et al. analyzed that in Ar–APPJs, a plume could only be formed outside the tube when the upstream electrode is connected to high voltage and the downstream electrode was grounded. This plume was mainly caused by the overflow of charged species under the action of the gas flow (Shao et al.2012). Shi et al. indicated that the difference of discharge mechanism between He–APPJs and Ar–APPJs was due to the lower excitation energy of Ar excited state compared to He, which made it difficult to induce Penning ionization. This also indicated that the discharge in Ar environment was extremely unstable (Shi et al.2008). Shao et al. also captured significant filamentary discharge phenomena in their experiments and pointed out the instability of Ar–APPJs (Shao et al.2012). Moreover, the temperature rise issue of Ar–APPJs was also more pronounced than that of He (Wang et al.2007). Thus, the temperature rise and the stability should be noticed in the application of Ar in APPJs.',\n",
       "  'Therefore, the gas environment of an APPJ device significantly influences the fundamental processes in the discharge. Scholars have utilized this characteristic to control discharge phenomena by mixing different gas components in a pure He/Ar environment, with significant effects observed. Martens et al. experimentally confirmed that even 1\\xa0ppm (mole fraction of 10–6) of N2could significantly affect He discharge (Martens et al.2008). Extensive experimental and simulation evidence shows that the introduction of gas molecules, such as N2, O2, and H2O, can be used to regulate parameters such as electron density, light intensity, and plume temperature (Zheng et al.2018; Ning et al.2014b; Liu et al.2010; Höft et al.2013,2014a; Pervez et al.2019). In addition to regulating the discharge, the introduction of other gas components can also introduce the desired reactive species to achieve better processing effects, such as the introduction of O2and CF4in material processing to provide surface reaction groups, or to etch silicon-based surfaces through F elements (Liu et al.2022; Gao et al.2009; Zhang et al.2012; Wang et al.2015; Chou et al.2015). In the processing of biological objects, the introduction of O2, H2O, and H2O2can increase the reactive species such as OH and O, providing better biomedical effects (Lietz and Kushner2018; Choi et al.2013; Liu et al.2018a; Lin et al.2021). Noted that the influences of additional gas components would also be different in different gas environment. As shown in Fig.5e by Liu et al. (2022) introduction of CF4would significantly decrease the plume length of Ar APPJs, while had little influence on the He APPJs.',\n",
       "  'In APPJs, gas is typically ejected at a certain flow rate, enabling the reactive species produced in the discharge region to migrate and diffuse into the atmospheric environment. Numerous studies have shown that the gas flow rate significantly affects characteristics of discharge, such as the plume length, gas temperature, and reactive species density of APPJs.',\n",
       "  'Simulation results by Naidis indicated that the ionization wave in the He–APPJ plume propagated approximately along the 99% He concentration He–air mixing layer (Naidis2011). Thus, the change in gas flow rate would alter the position of the He-air interface and consequently influencing the plume length. Bourdet et al. (2009) found a significant relationship between plume length and gas flow velocity, with the plume length initially increasing and then decreasing with increasing flow rate. The reason is that as the gas flow rate increases, the interface between the working gas and air extends gradually, thus allowing the ionization wave to propagate further and form a longer plume length. However, results of Li et al. (2009a) indicated that when the gas flow rate exceeded a certain threshold, the APPJ plume length shortened, and the discharge may even quenched, consistent with the experimental results of Zhang et al. (2024a). Because when the gas flow rate is high, the downstream airflow field becomes disrupted, transitioning from laminar to turbulent flow, resulting in the inability to form a stable plume outside the tube (Sobota et al.2016; Shao et al.2011). The plume length gradually shortens during this process, and even leads to discharge quenching. It is worth noting that the longer plume length at low flow rates can also affect the surface treatment effect. Sakiyama et al. (2010) found that when the He flow rate was 0.5 slm, the O density on the grounded electrode surface showed a solid distribution, while O was distributed in a ring shape on the grounded surface as the gas flow rate increased to 1 slm. Goree et al. also discovered that as the flow rate increased, the pattern of bacteria killed by the plasma needle surface disinfection experiment transformed from a solid circular pattern to a hollow ring pattern (Goree et al.2006a,b). Yan et al.’s simulation results explained this phenomenon, mainly due to the increased propagation distance of the discharge ionization wave outside the tube as the gas flow rate increased. When the flow rate was low, the annular ionization wave had already converged to a solid “bullet” at the grounded electrode position. However, as the flow rate increased, the He–air interface extended, and the propagation distance of the annular “bullet” also increased. Since the distance between the grounded electrode and the tube opening did not change, the solid “bullet” formed at low flow rates remained annular at high flow rates (Yan and Economou2017).',\n",
       "  'The impact of gas flow rate on gas temperature is also worth discussing. Clearly, an increase in gas velocity enhances convective heat dissipation, thereby reducing gas temperature, which is an ideal effect for applications that require temperature control. Wang et al.’s (2007) experimental study on micro-plasmas in He and Ar showed that an increase in gas velocity effectively lowered the gas temperature of the plasma, with a more pronounced decrease in Ar, indicating that Ar cooling relies more on convective heat dissipation. Li et al.’s study indicated that when the gas flow rate increased from 0.5 lpm to 10 lpm, the gas temperature of the Ar–APPJ decreased from 670 to 450\\xa0K. This cooling effect would feed back into the electrical characteristics of the APPJs, ultimately leading to an enhanced electric field and increased voltage in the plume region (Li et al.2009b).',\n",
       "  'In addition to the ring-shaped distribution mentioned above, numerous studies have shown that gas flow rate affects the migration of charged species and the diffusion of neutral species. The electric field is thus also influenced, as pointed out by Sobota et al. (2016). When the He flow rate increased from 0.7 slm to 2 slm, the electric field gradually became more elongated in the side direction, demonstrating that gas flow rate significantly affected the electric field. On the other hand, changes in gas flow rate can alter the diffusion velocity of neutral species, thereby affecting plasma chemistry. Simulation by Norberg et al. showed that while an increase in gas flow rate led to a significant change in the distribution of RONS. At low flow rates, O, O2excited states, and O3could not diffuse outside the tube. But when the flow rate is above 4 slm, these reactive species could diffuse outside the tube and exert their effects. Additionally, if the gas flow rate was 7 slm, when the next pulse voltage arrives, the APPJ had already returned to the original environment before discharge, while in the case of low flow rate, residual reactive species would significantly affect the dynamics of the next discharge (Norberg et al.2015a). 1D model study by Hasan et al. indicated that gas flow rate affected the main chemical reactions in the downstream discharge region of the APPJs, significantly altering the composition of several key reactive chemical species (OH, H2O2, NO2, and HNO3) delivered to specific downstream locations (Hasan and Walsh2017).',\n",
       "  'In summary, the impact of gas flow rate on APPJs discharge characteristics is multifaceted. First, an increase in gas flow rate will lead to increasing and then decreasing plume length, which indirectly results in the uniform problem of reactive species distribution. Second, the increase of gas flow rate reduces the gas temperature of APPJs. Finally, gas flow rate can affect the density and spatial distribution of reactive species in APPJs.',\n",
       "  'The discharge in APPJs will be quenched by O2with highly electronegative upon entering the atmospheric environment, with a significant amount of energy consumed in the complex molecular vibrations and rotations in air. Uncontrollable complex reaction processes of APPJs upon entering the air is an important issue, which would reduce the discharge intensity and density of reactive species. Therefore, Reuter et al. (2012a,b) proposed a method to control the reaction products of APPJs using a gas curtain as a barrier. This “gas curtain”, also known as “shielding gas”, creates a barrier by adding a circle of gas flow channels around the APPJ. This approach not only changes the gas composition at the nozzle to influence the reactive species, but also envelops the plume near the nozzle in the shielding gas and avoiding premature quenching of the discharge. In these APPJs, shielding gas injection is encapsulated around the jet device. Reuter et al. used N2and O2as the shielding gas, with the same flow rate as the working gas Ar, which was 5 slm. The introduction of the shielding gas (in this case, O2) slightly shortened the plume length but changed the color of the plume, eliminating the purple light representing N2emission, indicating that the shielding gas effectively isolated the influence of N2from the ambient air on the plume (Iseni et al.2016). Schmidt-Bleker et al. conducted further simulation and experimental studies based on the above device, adjusting the composition ratio of the shielding gas consisting of N2/O2/H2O. They found that an increase in O2led to an increase in the density of O3in the plume, while the increase of H2O reduced the O3density (Schmidt-Bleker et al.2014,2015,2016). Yue et al. based on experiments and simulations, compared three methods of introducing O2: directly mixing O2in the working gas, adding O2in the downstream region outside the tube, and adding O2through shielding gas, to investigate which method can achieve the highest O density (Yue et al.2016b). The results showed that the O2in the shielding gas has almost no effect on the O density in the plume region, which was contradictory to the results by Schmidt-Bleker et al. Possible reasons may be the different objects of interest in the experimental process (O and O3), or different driving power sources used (Schmidt-Bleker used RF power, while Yue et al. used pulsed source). Further research is needed to discuss this problem. Lin et al. studied the effect of the N2component of the shielding gas when He–APPJ is injected into an Ar/dry air environment, and the simulation results confirmed the barrier effect of the shielding gas, preventing the surrounding ambient gas from affecting the APPJ plume. Additionally, it was noted that the shielding gas could reduce the gas temperature of APPJs (Lin et al.2020).',\n",
       "  'In summary, shielding gas is a new method proposed in the past decade for controlling the composition of APPJ. Its main function is to isolate the impact of the external environment on the APPJ plume. Studies have also shown that the shielding gas can affect the plasma characteristics, temperature, and reactive species composition of the APPJ plume. However, there are still many uncertainties about the specific effects of the shielding gas, including how to control the gas composition through the shielding gas, and the effect in specific applications.',\n",
       "  'During the surface treatment process, the plasma generated by APPJs will affect the surface characteristics. Similarly, the surface characteristics will also have a significant impact on the plasma dynamics, leading to the acceleration of ionization waves, changes in the discharge area electric field, and changes in light emission intensity compared to the case without a target surface (Viegas et al.2020; Tran et al.2021). According to existing literature, we categorize the surface characteristics that affect APPJ plasma dynamics into several aspects: the distance between APPJs and surfaces, the geometric structure of surface, and the electrical characteristics of surfaces, i.e., the permittivity and conductivity of surfaces.',\n",
       "  'The distance between APPJ and surfaces significantly affects the intensity and distribution of the discharge. Hao et al. conducted a parametric study on the distancedbetween the Ar–APPJ nozzle and the grounded surface. Experimental results showed that the position of the downstream grounded surface has a significant impact on the light intensity and discharge power (Hao et al.2014a). Tran et al. diagnosed electron density, electron temperature, and other parameters in the discharge region between APPJ and the target surface. The results indicated that when the distance between the APPJ nozzle and the surface decreased, the electron density near the surface became higher, while the electron temperature near the surface didn’t vary significantly (Tran et al.2021). Nascimento et al. analyzed the impact of the distance between the APPJ and the PP film on the water contact angle (WCA) of the film. Results showed that when the distance was short, the decrease in the WCA of PP film presented a clear ring-like pattern. When the distance increased to above 9\\xa0mm, the WCA at the central position decreases significantly, while the WCA at the surrounding positions remains almost unchanged (Nascimento et al.2022).',\n",
       "  'Actually, the impact of the distance between APPJs and surfaces is multifaceted. On the one hand, the obstruction of the surface affects the gas flow field of APPJs. When the distance between the APPJ nozzle and the surface is far, the obstruction is weak, and the gas flow velocity in the area near the nozzle is not significantly affected. However, when the distance is short, due to the obstruction of surface, both the flow velocity and direction of the gas change significantly, affecting the spatial distribution of the working gas and ambient air. Model study by Breden et al. showed that when the distance between the surface and the jet nozzle is reduced from 2 to 0.5\\xa0cm, the He flow velocity in the direction perpendicular to the surface increases, affecting the He spatial distribution (Breden and Raja2014). On the other hand, there is the issue of the electric field distribution in the discharge region downstream of APPJs. At a given voltage, shorter distance implies denser distribution of potential contours, leading to stronger electric field and faster propagation speed of the ionization wave (Breden and Raja2014; Konina et al.2024). It should be noted that the electric field distribution from the APPJ downstream to the surface discharge region must consider the influence of surface potential. Viegas et al. analyzed the discharge dynamics of an APPJ over a grounded metal surface and a floating potential metal surface. Simulation results indicated that at the moment of discharge initiation, the surface potential of the floating potential was approximately equivalent to grounding, but at the end of the 1\\xa0μs pulse, the floating potential metal surface generates an extremely high voltage, which may exceed half of the applied voltage (Viegas et al.2020).',\n",
       "  'Clearly, a smaller APPJ–surface spacing results in a stronger discharge. However, a closer spacing also affects the distribution of the gas, which may lead to non-uniform surface treatment. Both excessively large and small discharge spacings are unsuitable. Therefore, an appropriate surface spacing will be expected in the applications.',\n",
       "  'In early studies of APPJ–surface interactions, the surface to be treated was often simplified as a flat plane. This results in a relatively uniform surface treatment effect and makes it easier to focus on the influence of the discharge and structural parameters of APPJs. However, in practical applications, the surfaces treated by APPJs often have various complex geometric structures. For instance, when treating human skin, the surface typically has various protrusions (such as acne, scars) and depressions (such as pores, wrinkles), and microchannels like hair follicles. For flexible porous materials like textiles, the internal microchannels will also affect the treatment efficacy. These complex geometries significantly influence the discharge behavior of APPJs, thereby affecting the surface treatment outcome. Hence, more researchers begin to focus on the impact of the surface morphology on APPJ dynamics.',\n",
       "  'Non-planar surfaces, i.e., the presence of protrusions or depressions on the surface to be treated, are common situation in APPJ surface treatment. It is necessary to investigate the influence of protrusions and depressions on APPJ discharge dynamics. Ning et al. studied the interaction between APPJ and non-planar surfaces using a fluid model as shown in Fig.6a. The induced charges on the non-planar surface led to split discharge forming on the surface, extending radially in a zigzag pattern. Additionally, the surface discharge by APPJs driven by negative and positive DC voltages was compared, finding that discharge on surface formed by negative DC APPJ was more uniform than positive DC APPJ as was the flux of short-lived reactive species like O and N (Ning et al.2018a). Jiang et al. further discussed the impact of the radius of surface geometric protrusions and depressions based on a similar model, discovering that there is a minimum radius beyond which discharge cannot penetrate into the concave areas (Jiang et al.2023b). Liu et al. conducted experimental research on the interaction between APPJs and non-planar surfaces, finding that APPJs exhibit path selectivity on 3D non-planar surfaces as shown in Fig.6b. Discharge by APPJ tended to propagate along concave positions, showing a significant correlation with the height and radius of surface protrusions and depressions (Liu et al.2024b). Raskar and Konina et al. studied the interaction between Ar/N2–APPJ and microchannel array surfaces through both experimental and simulation methods shown in Fig.6c. The geometric structure of the microchannels significantly alters the electric field distribution, inducing discharge to form first at the corner positions at the top of the microchannels. The propagation process of discharge on the microchannel array surface is explained through surface ionization waves, bulk ionization waves, and restrikes (Konina et al.2024; Raskar et al.2024). These studies indicate that non-planar surfaces strongly influence the discharge path of APPJs, due to the non-uniform surface electric field and surface-induced charges. High surface electric fields induce discharge channels to form first at the tops of protrusions, and the rapid accumulation of charge on the surface prevents further discharge penetration into concave areas (Fu et al.2019b). Moreover, when discharge propagates radially on the surface, higher protrusions may also block photon transmission, significantly affecting the propagation process of surface discharge as highlighted by Konina et al. (2022).',\n",

       "  'Microchannels are another common geometric structure encountered in APPJ surface treatment. These microchannels are often long and deep, making them difficult to penetrate with conventional treatment or processing methods. Plasma generated by APPJs can be formed inside the microchannels to achieve better treatment effects. Discharge within microchannels is significantly related to the surface charge and electric field on the sides of microchannels. Ning et al. investigated discharge induced by APPJs in μm-level microchannels in catalysts. Results showed that when the microchannels connected to an internal cavity of mm size, plasma would be initially produced in the cavity, and then developed from the cavity towards microchannels. At last, plasma was successfully generated inside the μm-level microchannels. Based on this phenomenon, a method was proposed to induce discharge in microchannels by constructing cavities within structural catalyst materials (Ning et al.2019). Further studies indicated that the discharge intensity formed by APPJs in catalyst microchannels was related to the capacitance of the catalyst material. Additionally, the shape and arrangement of the internal cavities of the catalyst affect the dynamic behavior of discharge within the cavities (Wenjun et al.2024). Konina et al. studied the development of discharge when APPJ treated hair follicles. The results showed that the discharge on the left and right sides of the hair follicle was uneven, tending to occur preferentially on the side away from the APPJ center, and the accumulated surface charge on the hair prevented discharge on the other side. Moreover, the intensity and uniformity of discharge within the hair follicle were sensitive to the angle between the follicle and the surface, the thickness of the skin layer, the permittivity, and the electrical conductivity, further highlighting the importance of surface charge in the process of APPJ-induced internal discharge in microchannels (Konina et al.2023). Kong et al. studied the treatment of fibers by APPJ by simulation method. Results showed that discharge would happen within the microchannels between fibers, and then extended into deeper layers. The fiber surface closest to the APPJ nozzle had a higher flux of reactive species. Furthermore, the narrower the microchannels between fibers, the smaller the treatment area of the fiber array, because high field strengths could develop through wider channels to produce discharge (Kong et al.2023a,b). It is evident that APPJs can induce discharge within microchannels, but the size of the microchannels should be at least larger than the Debye length (usually around 10\\xa0μm). Otherwise, APPJs cannot induce discharge within the microchannels because bipolar diffusion of charged species cannot occur, preventing discharge from passing through (Konina et al.2022).',\n",
       "  'We also need to discuss a special surface structure—the gas–liquid interface. The application of APPJs in treating liquids is a common scenario in bio-medicine. Liquid surface will be deformed by the gas flow of APPJs, leading to complex surface geometries that affecting the discharge behavior. Park et al. have pointed out that when airflow impacts the liquid surface, a downwardly concave would be formed, and the boundary of this cavity would become unstable as gas flow rate was high. However, when plasma was generated in cavity by APPJ, the electron wind created hydrodynamic forces at the interface, increasing the volume and stability of the cavity (Park et al.2021). This cavity on the liquid surface led to various outcomes. Firstly, changes in the surface structure affect the shape of the APPJ plume. As the gas flow rate increases and the cavity on the liquid surface expands, the diameter of the laminar flow and the distance of gas flow along the liquid surface correspondingly increase, resulting in an increase in the plasma diameter(Uchida et al.2015). Second, the gas flow and the electric field of APPJ disrupt the internal flow within the liquid, altering the distribution of reactive species in the liquid (Brubaker et al.2019; Lindsay et al.2015; Ryan et al.2024). At last, APPJs enhance convection on the liquid surface, increase liquid evaporation and decrease the surface temperature (~\\u200910\\xa0K) (Lindsay et al.2015; Stancampiano et al.2021).',\n",
       "  'Clearly, the surface geometry significantly affects the dynamic behavior of APPJs, primarily related to the establishment of surface charge and surface electric fields. Different surface structures will markedly alter the plasma treatment effects, with particular attention warranted for uniformity issues. Understanding the interaction processes between surfaces with complex geometry can help optimize the treatment effects of APPJs in practical applications, improve treatment uniformity, and promote the expansion and scale-up of APPJs.',\n",
       "  'The electrical properties of the target surface significantly influence the dynamics of discharge on surface. The electrical properties are primarily represented by two parameters in the study of APPJs interaction with surfaces: the relative permittivityεrand the electrical conductivityσ, corresponding to the displacement current and conduction current on the target surface. If the target surface is considered as an element in electrical circuits, the current flowing from the APPJs can return to the ground through both displacement and conduction currents (Norberg et al.2015b). The displacement current characterizes the process of the changing electric field, while the conduction current represents the directed movement of charges inside the target.',\n",
       "  'Depending on the electrical conductivityσof the target surface, materials can be categorized into three types: ideal dielectrics (σ=\\u20090), lossy dielectrics (0\\u2009<σ<\\u2009∞), and metals (σ→\\u2009∞). When the target surface is an ideal dielectric with a conductivity of 0, only displacement current exists in the dielectric. In this case, the relative permittivityεrinfluences the equivalent capacitance size of the dielectric, as indicated by capacitance determination formula (C=εS/4πkd). When the dielectric has a certain electrical conductivity, there will be a component of conduction current in the circuit. Accumulation of charges on the surface is temporary as the accumulated surface charge is consumed through the conduction current pathway. The relative permittivityεrand the electrical conductivity σ together determine the charge relaxation timeτ. When the material is a metal, conductivityσwill be close to infinity, and no charge accumulation occurs within the material. The plasma dynamics of APPJs on the surfaces of these three types of material is significantly different.',\n",
       "  'For ideal dielectrics (σ=\\u20090), the discharge is conducted solely through displacement current. To maintain current continuity, the charging process spreads to the surrounding surfaces after a surface area is charged. During this process, surface electric field and surface ionization waves (SIWs) propagate along the surface until the discharge is unable to sustain the surface electric field, as depicted in Fig.7c (Klarenaar et al.2018). The relative permittivityεrsignificantly affects charge accumulation during this process. Theoretically, a smallerεrresults in a smaller capacitanceC, leading to a shorter charging time for the surface, and thus an accelerated propagation speed of the SIW (Morsell et al.2023). Norberg et al. simulated the process of APPJ treating dielectric surfaces withεrvalues of 2, 5, 10, and 80, and their findings were consistent with the aforementioned theoretical predictions, shown in Fig.7a, b. They also noted that a lower εr can promote the propagation of the electric field on the medium surface, while a higher εr hinders the diffusion of the ionization wave on the surface, fostering a surface-to-APPJ return stroke process, thereby creating a stronger conduction current pathway between the APPJ and the surface (Norberg et al.2015b). Viegas et al. studied APPJ treatment of dielectric surfaces withεrvalues of 1, 4, 20, 56, and 80, and found that a larger permittivity delayed the diffusion of the SIW along the surface, primarily due to the increased vertical electric field and weakened parallel electric field with higher permittivity (Viegas and Bourdon2019). Jiang et al. and Konina et al. investigated the impact of permittivity on APPJ treatment of non-planar surfaces. Simulation results by Jiang et al. (2023b) indicated that a higher permittivity reduced the treatment radius of the APPJ, and discharge was more likely to concentrate on areas with higher curvature on the protruding side, making it difficult to penetrate into the bottom of depressions. Results by Konina et al. (2024) also confirmed that when the permittivity increased, the diffusion of the SIW generated by the APPJ was significantly slow, and the discharge tended to be closer to the surface, with less diffusion into the air domain.',\n",
       "  'a,bSimulation results of electron density when APPJ treating dielectric with different permittivity and metal(Norberg et al.2015b);cICCD photos of APPJ treating glass(Klarenaar et al.2018);dICCD photos of APPJ treating Cu (Klarenaar et al.2018)',\n",
       "  'When APPJs treat metallic materials, they exhibit completely different discharge behavior compared to ideal dielectrics, as shown in Fig.7d. The discharge above metallic materials often concentrates in very small areas and does not spread to the surroundings, primarily due to the presence of free electrons that can conduct within the metallic material, which eliminates the charge accumulation process, and the current entering the material flows entirely through conduction current to the ground point. Additionally, from time-resolved ICCD images, it is observed that the discharge develops from the surface towards the APPJ, known as the “return stroke” phenomenon. In long exposure images or with the naked eye, significant bright spots are visible on the metallic surface. Norberg et al. compared the surface of metals with that of low permittivity surfaces and concluded that the SIW and the return stroke process of metals compared to high permittivity surfaces were contradictory. The generation of SIW consumed the longitudinal electric field, while the SIW of metals and high permittivity surfaces was weaker, with a strong vertical electric field, resulting in a stronger and more concentrated return stroke process (Norberg et al.2015b). Babaeva et al. (2019) also observed similar phenomena in their simulations, noting that the forward ionization wave generated by the APPJ on metals was stronger than that on dielectric materials, and it produced a reverse secondary ionization wave, or “reflect”. Liu et al. (2021b) observed changes in surface discharge during the process of APPJ moving from glass to metal in their experiments, finding that the discharge area formed by APPJ on the surface gradually decreased, while the discharge intensity, emission intensity, and local electric field gradually increased. He et al. conducted experimental studies that indicated that both metallic targets and dielectric surfaces can promote the development of the jet and accelerate the jet velocity. The initial electrostatic voltage on both surfaces is positive, with the amplitude first increasing and then decreasing, and gradually transitioning to negative with the increase in applied voltage. However, the metallic surface can change the discharge mode and, under certain conditions, reduce the discharge current (He et al.2024).',\n",
       "  \"Lossy non-ideal dielectric materials exhibit characteristics between metals and ideal dielectrics, with the introduction of electrical conductivityσincreasing the pathways for conduction current, thereby weakening the effect of displacement current. The absolute permittivityεand the electrical conductivity σ of the medium jointly determine the charge relaxation timeτ(τ=ε/σ), i.e., the residence time of charge on the surface. This can be used as a reference to clearly define the dominance of conduction and displacement currents. A largerτindicates a longer residence time of charge on the surface, slower dissipation, and a closer resemblance to ideal electrolytes, while a smallerτmeans charges are more difficult to accumulate, and the material's properties are more similar to metals. Such lossy dielectric materials often appear in biomedical applications, considering the electrical effects caused by capillaries, physiological saline environments, etc. It can be considered that skin exhibits characteristics of lossy dielectrics. Some synthetic materials mixed with metal materials and semiconductor materials such as silicon-based materials also have similar electrical characteristics. Abuzairi et al. studied the APPJ treatment of copper, silicon (semiconductor), and photoresist (dielectric) materials and found that the discharge luminosity intensity and the radius of extension on the surface during APPJ treatment of silicon-based materials were between those of copper and photoresist under different voltages (Abuzairi et al.2016). Babaeva et al. (2019) found that when APPJ treats dielectric materials with a certain electrical conductivity, the electric field in space is between that of metals and ideal dielectrics. Additionally, when the dielectric plate was placed at a certain angle, lossy dielectric materials could deflect the APPJ plume, and the deflection would be more pronounced as the conductivity is larger (Babaeva et al.2021). Konina et al. (2024) indicated that when APPJ acts on lossy non-planar surfaces, an increase in conductivity restricts the radius of SIW diffusion, but the body discharge of APPJ is correspondingly significantly enhanced.\",\n",
       "  'This section will focus on the kinetics of APPJs in the interaction between APPJs and surfaces. The presence of the surface imposes constraints on the movement of plasma, thereby affecting plasma behavior. The bulk processes and surface processes occurring in APPJ surface treatment will be introduced respectively. Bulk processes indicate the fundamental processes happening in the gas before plume of APPJs reaching surfaces, containing the bulk ionization waves (IWs), reaction kinetics in the gas, gas flow control, and gas heating. The part of surface processes mainly focuses on the discharge kinetics after plume reaching the surfaces, such as surface charging and surface ionization waves (SIWs), sheath, surface reactions and surface heating. This section aims to give readers a more detailed understanding of the kinetics in APPJ–surface interactions through the introduction of these processes.',\n",
       "  'Although the discharge of APPJ appears continuous to the naked eye, the ionization waves propagating downstream are actually discrete, which is so-called “plasma bullets”. Plasma bullets in He APPJ were first observed by Teschke et al. (2005) shown in Fig.8a.They found that the propagation speed of these bullets could reach about 104m/s, which was significantly faster than the gas flow speed. Walsh et al. (2010) further studied the He–APPJ driven by AC power, and found three discharge modes as the input power increased: chaotic, bullet, and continuous modes as shown in Fig.8b. After gas breakdown occurs in the APPJ, it first operated in chaotic mode, where the discharge occurs randomly in positive and negative half-cycles. As the input power increases, the discharge of the APPJ enters a bullet mode with good repeatability, producing a plasma bullet in each half cycle. After the input power was further increased, the APPJ began to work in continuous mode. The current waveform and light emission intensity remained at a high level during the whole half cycle. Walsh et al. believe that in bullet mode, the ionizing waves in APPJ mainly rely on photoionization propagation, showing the characteristics of stream discharge, while in continuous mode, the discharge in APPJ is more similar to glow discharge.',\n",
       "  'Researches on the fundamental characteristics, impact of gas atmosphere, and interactions of plasma bullets',\n",
       "  \"Based on a large number of experimental and simulation results, the main characteristics of plasma bullets are summarized. First, the velocity of the plasma bullet is about 104m/s to 105m/s, which is much higher than the gas flow rate, as well as the drift and diffusion speed of electrons and ions (Lu and Laroussi2006), indicating that the propagation of the plasma bullet is mainly driven by the electric field. Second, plasma bullets have a typical hollow structure (Teschke et al.2005; Yubin et al.2009) as shown in Fig.8c and gradually shrink to a solid structure as they progress downstream. The formation of this hollow structure is related to the problem of uneven distribution caused by gas diffusion. Third, plasma bullets leave behind a dark channel as they travel. Shashurin et al. photographed the plasma channel at 100\\xa0ns exposure time and found that the plasma bullet was connected to the nozzle through a relatively weak but present luminous channel (Shashurin et al.2012). Fourth, the propagation speed and length of plasma bullets are affected by gas pressure, voltage, and excitation source form (Ning et al.2014a; Laroussi and Akman2011; Xian et al.2012a). At present, the formation mechanism of plasma bullets is usually explained by the stream theory based on photoionization. Walsh's experimental results indicate that in bullet mode, the plasma head does undergo a series of repeated processes of formation, collapse, and regeneration, which is consistent with Dawson's photoionization theory (Walsh et al.2010). Lu et al. (2006) built a mathematical model based on Dawson’s photoionization theory to explain the generation and development of plasma bullets. Based on experimental observations, Ning et al. (2014a) described the plasma bullet as a positive stream and believed that a large amount of space charges accumulated inside it, which enhanced the electric field and promoted its propagation. However, there are some significant differences between plasma bullets and traditional stream discharges. First, the start of the plasma bullet is repeatable, while the start of the stream is random. The radiation from the plasma bullet then presents a ring structure, while the stream does not. Finally, there are dark luminous channels in the tail of the plasma bullet, and in the stream theory, the charge of the region through which the stream head passes will be completely neutralized, contradicting this phenomenon (Lu et al.2012).\",\n",
       "  'The formation and characteristics of plasma bullets are closely related to the gas environment. In fact, the hollow structure of the plasma bullet in He–APPJ is related to the He–air mixing layer downstream of the APPJ. Zhu et al. (2009) and Wu et al. (2011) independently observed experimentally that after a He–APPJ was injected into a pure helium atmosphere, a directional jet would not be produced, but instead developed a spherical ionization wave that diffuses evenly around it as shown in Fig.8d. This result was significantly different from the reversed hollow plume when injected into air, indicating the influence of the He–air mixing layer on the morphology of the He–APPJ plume. Simulation results by Naidis indicated that the ionization wave in the He–APPJ plume propagated approximately along the 99% He concentration He–air mixing layer, explaining the reason for the reversed cone shape and the transition of the “bullets” from a ring shape to a solid state (Naidis2011). It is evident that ambient air significantly affects the formation, development, and quenching of discharge in He–APPJs, primarily manifested in two aspects. First, the quenching of the discharge in the He–air mixing layer indicates that the high-energy electrons produced by the discharge are severely consumed by new reaction processes, such as O2adsorption, N2and O2vibrational and rotational excitation when transitioning from the He environment to the air environment. Therefore, after the APPJ is injected into an air atmosphere, the air components significantly affect the discharge dynamics of the APPJ plume (Lu et al.2021). Second, the impact of Penning ionization, where the energy released from He excited states promotes the ionization of N2and O2, is an important reaction occurring at the head of the He–APPJ ionization wave, significantly influencing the discharge propagation speed and radius (Breden et al.2011; Chang et al.2014). Recently, Peng et al. found that under certain conditions, plasma bullets exhibit a hollow-solid structure. This plasma bullet consists of two concentric discharge layers, the outer layer is a purple hollow ring formed mainly by nitrogen ionization, and the inner layer is a red solid bullet formed mainly by helium ionization. They believe that the inner discharge layer is also initially a hollow ring structure, forming a \"hollow-hollow\" structure with the outer ring, but due to the coulomb repulsive force between the two layers of plasma, the inner ring rapidly shrinks into a solid core, forming a \"solid–hollow\" structure. The experimental results show that a higher pulse repetition rate and a longer pulse rising edge are more likely to form a solid–hollow bullet (Peng et al.2024). This result also proves the relationship between hollow bullets and the He–air mixed layer.',\n",
       "  'Working gas also has a significant effect on the plasma bullets. For air APPJ, it is clear that no gas mixing layer is formed, and the characteristics of its plasma bullets are also different. The experimental results of Xian et al. (2012b) prove that the propagation speed of plasma bullets in air APPJ is slow as shown in Fig.8e. The propagation speed of plasma bullets in air APPJ is similar to that of air flow, which indicates that the propulsion of plasma bullets mainly depends on the diffusion effect of air flow. Mixing other gas impurities in the noble gas also affects the plasma bullets in the APPJ. For example, Ning et al. found a \"double bullet\" phenomenon when mixing 10sccm O2in a 3slm He as shown in Fig.8f. The average speed of the two bullets is 7.8\\xa0km/s and 6.5\\xa0km/s respectively. When the oxygen flow exceeds 10 sccm, the “double bullet” phenomenon reverts to the single bullet condition. They believe that the double bullet phenomenon is the result of a specific space charge density interaction. In this experimental setup, 10 sccm of oxygen mixed with 3 slm of helium reduced the space charge to a level just suitable for the generation of a “double bullet” (Ning et al.2014b). Ning et al. (2018b) then studied the interaction of He–APPJ mixed with N2with the downstream surface and found that mixing 0.5% N2in the working gas caused the plasma bullet to change from a hollow structure to a solid structure when it reached the surface. Park et al. observed the phenomenon of multiple bullets in He/N2APPJ and found that the number of bullets increased correspondingly with the increase of N2concentration, up to 8 bullets. They believe that when the concentration of nitrogen reaches a certain value, the number of electrons produced by Penning ionization is similar to the number of electrons produced by the collision of electrons ionizing helium atoms. At the tail of the first bullet, the electrons produced by Penning ionization can enhance the electric field strength near the anode beyond that required for helium breakdown, resulting in subsequent bullets (Park et al.2013).',\n",
       "  'The interaction of plasma bullets has also been extensively studied. Douat et al. observed two relatively advancing plasma bullets, as shown in Fig.8. They found that when two plasma bullets are less than 3.5\\xa0mm apart, they begin to interact electrically. The bullet on top begins to expand radially and forms a fine point at the bottom. After a few nanoseconds, a secondary bullet separates from the core of the upper bullet and travels downward at 100\\xa0km/s. They suggested that the formation of the secondary bullet may be related to electrons being extracted from the upper bullet (Douat et al.2011). Lu et al. summarized the interactions between relatively advanced plasma bullets. In a closed environment filled with noble gases, the experimental results show that two plasma bullets in opposite directions merge into a larger plasma bullet after meeting, and its luminous intensity is greater than that of a single bullet. In air, two plasma bullets in opposite directions form a spherical pink glow upon meeting, accompanied by a significant increase in the nitrogen excited state and nitrogen ion emission intensity (Lu et al.2012). For plasma bullets in the same direction, such as those in an APPJ array, the interaction depends on the distance between APPJs. Babaeva et al. studied the effect of distance D between APPJ on plasma bullets, and the simulation results are shown in Fig.8h. When the distance between the jets is large (D\\u2009=\\u20090.32\\xa0cm), each jet forms an independent helium channel. The plasma bullets travel independently in their respective helium channels and have little interaction with each other. When the distance between the jets is medium (D\\u2009=\\u20090.16\\xa0cm), the merging phenomenon occurs in the helium region. Electrostatic repulsion occurs between the plasma bullets, causing them to move along the edge of the He-air interface and converge into a weaker bullet downstream. When the distance between the jets is small (D\\u2009=\\u20090.105\\xa0cm), the helium channels immediately merge to form a single channel. The two plasma bullets quickly converged into one, and the strength increased significantly (Babaeva and Kushner2014).',\n",
       "  'In general, the formation of plasma bullets is related to the uneven distribution of downstream gas caused by airflow diffusion. The type of working gas and impurity gas will significantly affect the morphology and characteristics of plasma bullets. Velocity and distance of plasma bullets are influenced by the parameters of power supply and air pressure. There are significant interactions between plasma bullets, including electrostatic repulsion, merger and other effects, which are related to the development direction of plasma bullets and the distance between jets. Morphology and propagation process of the plasma bullet are closely related to the plume length, treatment area and treatment uniformity of the APPJ. The discharge propagates to the downstream surface through the plasma bullet and causes a series of electrical processes on the surface. Therefore, the treatment effect of the APPJ on the downstream surface can be changed by controlling the plasma bullet.',\n",
       "  'Reactive nitrogen and oxygen species (RONS) are important in the surface treatment of APPJ and have a variety of different biological and chemical effects. RONS are diverse and include electrons, metastable species (excited states of He and Ar, rotational/vibrational dynamics of N2and O2), atoms (O, N), groups (OH, COOH), ions (O2-, N2+), molecular compounds (NO, O3), etc. Different types of RONS have different effects, and different application scenarios also have different requirements for RONS density.',\n",

Therefore, it is necessary to understand the density and distribution of reactive species in APPJ, which requires a variety of precision diagnostic methods. Ono et al. (2016) and Lu et al. (2016) made a very comprehensive review of these experimental diagnostic methods. Unfortunately, due to the variety of RONS and the errors caused by some invasive diagnostic methods, there are still some RONS that are difficult to accurately diagnose. Therefore, many researchers use reaction dynamics models to study the density and distribution of RONS in space, and trace the source and consumption of RONS through numerical models. Excellent work based on global models (Liu et al.2010; Ning et al.2023; Park et al.2008), 1D models (Liu et al.2015), 2D models (Lietz and Kushner2018; Norberg et al.2015a) and mixed models (Bissonnette-Dulude et al.2024; Zhang et al.2024b) has basically revealed the reaction dynamics in plasmas.

Diagnosis of electron density in APPJ is summarized by Nikiforov et al., mainly including electric probe measurement (and through the calculation of current and voltage parameters), infrared heterodyne interferometry, continuum radiation, Thomson scattering, Rayleigh microwave scattering, Stark broadening of spectral lines, and so on(Nikiforov et al.2015). Each method has different ranges, and time and spatial resolutions. In recent papers, Thomson scattering, Rayleigh microwave scattering, and Stark broadening of spectral lines are the more commonly used methods. But these methods often require complex experimental equipment and precise calibration, and have high requirements for experimental conditions. As the most important species in plasma, electrons participate in many basic processes in plasma, mainly generated by various ionization reactions and quenched by recombination and attachment. Specific reactions are not listed in Table1, and only the types of reactions in which electrons participate are outlined.',\n",
       "  'He/Ar is the most used background gas in APPJ. Due to the high ionization energy of He/Ar (Bibinov et al.2011), it is more likely to be excited (R1) rather than directly ionized after electron collision in the APPJ plume. He*/Ar*, excited state of He/Ar, plays an important role in the discharge dynamics of APPJ. They can act as a store of electron energy, triggering stepwise ionization (R2), or a strong Penning ionization reaction (R3) at the interface between noble gases and air to maintain electrical discharge (Myers et al.2024). As mentioned above, Penning ionization reaction is one of the main reasons for the formation of hollow structures along the noble gas–air interface of plasma bullets, which has significant effects on the morphology, velocity and firing distance of plasma bullets under different gas environments. In addition, He*/Ar* is in a metastable state, causing them to potentially emit photons, triggering further photoionization and affecting discharge (Lietz and Kushner2018). At the same time, this property also allows He*/Ar* to be diagnosed by optical emission spectroscopy (OES). Similarly, they can also absorb photons of specific bands into higher energy states or ionize, resulting in a specific absorption spectrum or radiation. Therefore, He*/Ar* can also be diagnosed by optical absorption spectroscopy (OAS), or laser-induced fluorescence (LIF).',\n",
       "  'Singlet delta oxygen (O2(1Δg)) has received a lot of attention in plasma medicine, mainly due to its biological effects within cells and its potential in cancer therapy (Felsher2003; Ravanat et al.2000; Ionin et al.2007). Since it is inherently metastable, diagnosis can be achieved with OES. Jiang et al. diagnosed O2(1Δg) produced by APPJ using the molecular beam mass spectrometer (MBMS) method, which takes advantage of the ionization energy difference between O2(12.1\\xa0eV) and O2(1Δg) (11.1\\xa0eV). When the electron energy of the ionization source is narrow enough, the difference between these two threshold energies enables the mass spectrometry to distinguish the resulting O2+signal, but the very small ionization energy difference also poses a diagnostic challenge (Jiang et al.2020a). In terms of reaction mechanism, O2(1Δg) is mainly produced by electron collision excitation (R5) and excitation energy transfer (R8) of O (1D), and further electron collisions lead to ionization (R6) or bond breaking (R7) of O2(1Δg). Like He*/Ar*, O2(1Δg) can temporarily store energy, releasing photons (R9) by colliding with other species, breaking down O3(R10), or allowing electrons attached to O2-to escape (R11).',\n",

O is an important precursor of O3and an important intermediate substance in plasma chemistry, so both of them have been studied in depth. O has a short lifetime, and the common diagnostic methods are VUV absorption spectroscopy and two-photon absorption laser induced fluorescence (TALIF). TALIF is often used in the diagnosis of atoms, because atomic species require VUV to achieve excitation if traditional single-photon LIF is used. Paper by Ono et al. (2016) provided a detailed theory of TALIF. The absorption spectrum of O can only be obtained by VUV radiation. O3, on the other hand, is stable and has a long life. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and UV absorption spectroscopy can be used. O is produced mainly by the decomposition of O2(R12, R13, R15), but also by the recombination reaction of O2-and O2+(R14). Its main consumption channel is through the three-body collision reaction with O2and background gas to form O3(R16). As a stable oxidizing agent, O3accumulates to a high concentration under repeated pulse discharge and participates in various reactions in the gas phase, such as the oxidation of NO (R32) and OH (R18) (Ning et al.2023). Harris et al. (2024) believe that O3is mainly consumed by collision with O2(b1Σu+) in plasma.',\n",
       "  'OH is also a key focus of researchers, especially for liquid handling. OH is a precursor of H2O2and an important oxidizing agent in the gas and liquid phases. Its density will directly affect the density of reactive species produced in the treated liquid and is a very important species for plasma-activated water (Zhou et al.2020). In terms of measurement and diagnosis of OH, Ono et al. used LIF method to carry out a lot of work, including the diagnosis of OH in corona discharge, APPJ plume, surfaces treated by APPJ and downstream atmosphere of APPJ (Ono and Tokuhiro2020; Yonemori and Ono2014; Yonemori et al.2012; Ono and Oda2008). OH is mainly produced by collision dissociation of electrons with H2O or H2O+in a gas (R19, R20). The most important consumption reactions are the three-body collisions to form H2O2(R22) and the formation of H2O (R21, R23) with H or another OH (Lin et al.2021).',\n",
       "  'The types of RNS are also very diverse, among which N atoms and N oxides have received extensive attention. As a short-lived atom, N is usually diagnosed using TALIF or MBMS, while NO spectrometry with a long life can be diagnosed using various diagnostic methods, such as OES, OAS, LIF, and mass spectrometry (Lu et al.2016). N is mainly produced by the electron collision dissociation reaction of N2(R24), while the consumption reaction includes the synthesis of N2, as well as the reaction with OH and NO. The experimental study of Schneider et al. pointed out that in the three-body reaction of R25, the number of atoms in the background gas He is not enough to explain the consumption of N, and in fact, R26 and R27 are likely to be the main consumption channels of N. N will form NO in the subsequent collision reaction, and NO will react with O and O3(R31, R32), and further oxidize to NO2, which will continue to oxidize to form NO3, and these oxides will also combine with each other to form N2O4, N2O5, and other compounds. In general, oxides of nitrogen undergo multistage reactions and eventually accumulate in relatively stable forms, such as NO2, N2O, and N2O5(Lietz and Kushner2016).',\n",
       "  'In summary, different types of RONS require different diagnostic methods due to their different characteristics, which makes simultaneous measurement of RONS difficult to achieve. In addition, invasive measurement methods such as LIF can cause additional problems. For example, Ono et al. point out that the energy of the laser may lead to the decomposition of O3resulting in an overestimation of O density. The above precision measurement means also require complex experimental platforms with high cost and high precision and precise calibration methods. Model research makes up for the defects of experimental diagnosis to a large extent. Many model studies have resulted in a relatively complete plasma chemistry, and a consensus has been reached on the reaction kinetics of some RONS. However, the reaction kinetics model is based on scientific knowledge, and the integrity of the reaction library cannot be proven. The lack of experimental diagnosis makes it difficult for the understanding of plasma reaction kinetics to be thoroughly and comprehensively verified. Therefore, precise diagnosis of RONS remains a critical part of plasma research.',\n",
       "  'Gas temperature is an important parameter of APPJ. On the one hand, it is related to safety and stability of APPJ application. For example, when treating with human tissues, the gas temperature of APPJ should not exceed 40 ℃ to avoid thermal damage to cells (Woedtke et al.2020). On the other hand, gas temperature can affect the reaction rate of reactive species in the APPJ plume, thus affecting the plasma reaction dynamics (Ono and Oda2008). In addition, the surface heating is also related to the heat transfer of the APPJ when the APPJ treats the surface, and it is possible to control the gas heating to affect the surface heating. Therefore, it is necessary to study gas heating in APPJ.',\n",
       "  'The gas heating mechanism of APPJ needs to consider many factors, including the ohmic thermal effect of current, the thermal effect of particle collision and chemical reaction, the convection heat dissipation of working gas, and the heat loss of tube wall. In current discussions of gas heating, the thermal effect of electric currents is usually less considered because the current generated by APPJ is usually low and is not usually included in the discussion. The thermal effect of gas phase chemistry is more complex, involving input power, gas chemistry, wall effect, etc., and has been paid attention to in discharge forms such as stream discharge (Komuro and Ono2014) and DBD (Zhu et al.2013). Komuro et al. summarized part of the mechanism by which energy transfer leads to gas heating in atmospheric pressure plasmas. They believe that the energy of the external power source is mainly stored in the background gas molecules. These energies are stored in a variety of modes, including electronic, vibrational, translational and rotational modes, corresponding to excited states, and vibrational and rotational dynamics, respectively. These storage modes have different time scales, and the time they enter thermal equilibrium is related to the time scale of the applied electrical pulse, so they need to be explained by different energy models (Komuro and Ono2014). In APPJ, gas heating also needs to consider the convection caused by air flow, which further complicates the study of gas heating effect in this process. Convective heat dissipation due to high gas flow rates is also commonly used to reduce the APPJ gas temperature. Nascimento et al. comprehensively studied the problem of gas heating effect at low temperature He–APPJ. Using a light temperature sensor and infrared imaging, they compared the gas temperature of the He air hitting the copper plate with and without discharge. The results show that most of the gas heating in He–APPJ may come mainly from the expansion effect of He gas. Even in the case of no discharge, with the increase of the distance between the copper plate and the gas nozzle, the gas temperature also increases, especially in the case of low He flow rate. This means that even when there is no discharge, the helium can transfer heat to the target material. Although the temperature increases with distance, it is still possible to produce plasma jets with temperatures below 40 ℃ at low He flow rates (do Nascimento et al.2023).',\n",
       "  'The flow field will also be affected by APPJ. The electric field generated by APPJ downstream will affect the migration of charged species through the electric field force, forming ionic wind. The effect of gas heating also causes the diffusion of species to be affected. Therefore, when the APPJ generates discharge, the downstream flow field will change significantly compared with that without discharge. This effect can have a significant effect when dealing with fluid surfaces, such as liquid surfaces (Park et al.2021; Ryan et al.2024). This effect can also assist in airflow control.',\n",
       "  \"Jiang et al. studied the interaction between discharge and airflow in APPJ based on Schlieren imaging system. They found that for unipolar APPJ settings, where the airflow is able to gain a forward momentum from the discharge, the high voltage will be able to form a slender plasma jet. For double-ring electrode APPJ discharge, the longest plume length can be formed only under appropriate voltage, and glow discharge caused by excessive voltage may cause turbulence in the plume region (Jiang et al.2011). Robert et al. performed simultaneous time-resolved ICCD imaging and Schlieren visualization to demonstrate the change of noble gas flow by plasma jets. They found that in addition to forming turbulence downstream of the APPJ, when the noble gas flow rate is higher (5slm), the plasma will result in a more stable laminar flow rather than turbulence (Robert et al.2014). Darny et al. revealed that in AC-driven APPJ, long-lived negative ions induce strong changes in gas propagation. The momentum generated by a series of voltage pulses accumulates and is transferred to the air surrounding the molecule, resulting in a stable airflow channel gradually building up on a time scale of tens of milliseconds. Their experimental results show that the plasma provided by the negative voltage pulse can produce a very stable cylindrical helium channel, while the positive voltage pulse can disturb the current. They suggest that with an appropriate combination of positive and negative polarity pulses, it is possible to benefit from both polarity features, thereby optimizing the propagation of the plasma plume and the transport of plasma to the target (Darny et al.2017). Doremaele et al. investigated the flow effect caused by APPJ hitting a glass substrate. Taking advantage of the large difference between air and helium in the Rayleigh cross section, they measured the distribution of air concentration in the jet outflow using the Rayleigh scattering method. The results show that the plasma widens the He channel, indicating that the gas speeds up and mixes with the surrounding air. They believe that gas heating and electrohydrodynamic (EHD) forces do not cause the observed phenomena. The surface charge of the treated surface may be the main cause of the plasma's effect on the gas flow (Doremaele et al.2018).\",\n",
       "  'It can be seen that the impact of discharge on the downstream flow is mainly to cause chaotic turbulence or establish a stable laminar flow, which is related to the polarity of the applied voltage, the flow rate of the flow, and the situation of the downstream target. According to the experimental results of Doremaele and Darny et al., the effect of gas heating on air flow in this process is small (Darny et al.2017; Doremaele et al.2018) mainly because in the rare gas environment, the temperature rise caused by gas heating is limited, and the effect on thermal diffusion is not enough to cause strong air flow changes. In contrast, the electrical effect is more significant than the thermal effect. The migration of charged species is affected, forming EHD and changing the distribution of the air stream. It should be noted that both studies by Nascimento et al. (2023) and Doremaele et al. (2018) revealed the influence of downstream targets on gas heating and flow, indicating that these processes are not independent of the target surface. On the one hand, the change of gas heating and flow will change the distribution of energy and reactive species transferred to the downstream target, on the other hand, it will also be affected by the characteristics and distance of the downstream target, and the two have a complex interaction.',\n",
       "  'When APPJs treat dielectric materials, streamers charging the surface upon contact transform bulk ionization waves (plasma bullets) into surface ionization waves (SIWs) due to the accumulation of surface charge, resulting in a parallel electric field to the surface. This process is closely related to the surface treatment area and effect, thus receiving extensive attention from researchers.',\n",
       "  'Discussions on SIW are more common in the context of dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) research, which is closely related to the discharge mode of DBD and typically appears at the feet of filamentary discharge, also known as “footprints”. Shape and characteristics of these “footprints” depend on the polarity of the dielectric covering the electrode (Gibalov and Pietsch2012; Höft et al.2014b). Further research indicates that generation and development of SIW on dielectric surfaces are the result of local enhancement of surface charge and electric field (Shcherbanev et al.2019). When bulk discharge contacts the target surface to be treated, the electric field is mainly vertical to the surface. After contact, the surface is charged at the contact point, generating a component of the electric field parallel to the surface, thereby inducing SIW propagation along the surface (Pechereau et al.2016). During the propagation of SIW along the surface, significant charge separation occurs at the SIW head, similar to the charge separation at the head of streamers in gas discharge. This charge separation causes an electron avalanche above the surface gas, promoting SIW propagation (Huang et al.2020). Moreover, the mismatch in relative permittivity between the medium and plasma also leads to polarization of the surface material and enhances the electric field on the dielectric surface (Slikboer et al.2019). The boundary between the plasma conductive region, the dielectric, and the surrounding air near the SIW head resembles the three-phase point, generating additional electric field enhancement that explains the continuous electron avalanche at the SIW head. The propagation of SIW can also be regarded as a continuous charging process of the dielectric surface capacitance. The SIW consumes the net charge at its head, charges the local surface capacitance of the dielectric below, and raises the voltage at the SIW head position. After the local charging is completed, the charged dielectric produces an electric field pointing to the uncharged dielectric ahead, guiding the propagation of the SIW. However, during this process, there is also a loss of charge at the SIW head, resulting in a voltage drop, which somewhat weakens the intensity of SIW (Konina et al.2022).',\n",
       "  'Generation and propagation of SIW are influenced by various factors. Section2.4.3has already summarized the effects of relative permittivity and conductivities; hence, they will not be elaborated upon here. In addition to surface electrical properties, model study by Li et al. (2020) showed that higher applied voltages would accelerate the generation and propagation speed of SIW, with the impact of surface secondary electron emission coefficient on SIW being insignificant, mainly due to stronger photoelectric ionization of the gas above the dielectric. Huang et al. (2020) measured the residual charge level on the dielectric surface and found that higher pulse repetition frequencies suppress the development of SIW using a Kelvin classic probe. Meyer et al. (2020) compared the development of positive polarity SIW on flat and grooved surfaces and found that the propagation speed on the grooved surface is approximately 1.8\\u2009×\\u2009108cm/s, 15% slower than on the flat surface, indicating that the propagation of SIW is significantly affected by surface structure. Konina et al.’s (2022) model further explored the influence of surface structure and found that the conformity of negative polarity SIW on a wavy dielectric surface is worse than that of positive polarity SIW, with the uniformity level of surface flux and the development path of SIW significantly related to the height of the surface prominences and depressions.',\n",
       "  \"In APPJ surface treatment, bulk ionizing waves (plasma bullets) arrive at the surface and charge the surface, subsequently forming SIWs. Norberg's simulation results illustrate this process as shown in Fig.9a (Norberg et al.2019). Because simulation of Norberg et al. uses a 2D axisymmetric simulation setup, only one SIW is shown here. In practice, the SIWs will spread out from the jet axis on the APPJ-treated surface, forming a nearly circular boundary. The extent of this boundary determines the size of the processing area. The range of surface charging energy maintenance is obviously related to the dielectric constant of the medium (which affects the charging capacitance), the applied voltage and the surface distance (which affects the discharge strength). The influence of dielectric constant is reflected in Fig.7b (Han et al.2023). A larger dielectric constant will lead to a larger charging capacitance, which can hold more charge and charge more slowly. Therefore, SIWs generated by APPJ can have a smaller diffusion radius. Based on Pockels effect, Han et al. (2023) photographed the surface charge distribution of BSO crystal surface under APPJ treatment with different voltages as shown in Fig.9b. It can be seen that the higher voltage can make the surface charge distribution area larger, meaning that the SIWs can spread further. After discharge, the dissipation of surface charge requires a certain relaxation time. If the repetition rate is high or the relaxation time is long, the accumulated charge of the previous pulse may be affected when the next pulse discharge arrives. Norberg et al. suggested that when APPJ processes biological tissue, the electric fields delivered to downstream tissues may accumulate at high pulse repetition rates and trigger electroporation. Raskar et al. measured the surface electric field using E-FISH when APPJ treated a surface containing microchannels, and found that the initial electric field in some regions was not zero before the pulse began (Raskar et al.2024). They think this is because the charge of the previous pulse has not dissipated. When the discharge produced by the next pulse approaches this location, it first neutralizes the charge there, making the electric field zero, and then begins to re-establish the electric field. It can be seen that the process of surface charge accumulation and dissipation has many effects on the SIW generated when APPJ treats the surface.\",\n",

However, in quantitative measurements, the commonly used Pockels effect research still has contradictions between the optical path and jet path. Nevertheless, clear observations of the establishment path of surface charge and electric field have been made. Currently, there are still few diagnostic methods for surface charge and electric field, and more diagnostic techniques are needed to obtain more quantitative characteristics of SIW and surface electric field.',\n",
       "  'Surface secondary electron emission (SEE) refers to the process in which stimulation of the surface causes electrons to overflow from the material, generating secondary electrons. This process alters the sheath potential, affecting surface current and thermal effects, and even impacts the ion sputtering process on surfaces (Schwager et al.1993). SEE is induced by ions, electrons, photons, and excited atoms incident on the surface; heavy species such as ions and atoms, with lower energy, generally cause SEE through the Auger emission process (Lieberman and Lichtenberg2005). In applications like ion implantation, SEE may also result from collisions with high-energy ions (Shamim et al.1991), but the plasma produced by APPJ is typically in a non-equilibrium state with lower ion energy, generally not causing SEE through high-energy ion collisions.',\n",
       "  'In the model study of APPJ, it is usually taken into account by setting the secondary electron emission coefficient γ. The secondary electron emission coefficient γ caused by positive ions is usually set between 0.05 and 0.2 (Konina et al.2024; Ning et al.2018a,b; Norberg et al.2015b). Photon-induced secondary ionization emission coefficient γphis set to 0.001–0.01(Georghiou et al.2000). When the volume ionization wave of APPJ reaches the surface, the secondary electron density emitted by the surface is calculated by multiplying the number of positive ions and photons arriving at the surface by the emission coefficient. Therefore, the secondary electron emission coefficient is similar to the emission probability. These parameters mainly affect the electron density of the surface, which in turn affects the electric potential and electric field of the surface. For example, Georghiou et al. discussed the influence ofγphin their study and found that asγphincreased from 0.001 to 0.01, the surface current significantly increased, the diffusion rate of surface electron density accelerated, and the gradient of the electric field strength along the surface decreased (Georghiou et al.2000). But the effect of SEE seems to be confined to the surface. Jacofsky et al. indicated the secondary electron emission plays a small role in the chemistry induced in the jet because no difference of reactive species generation was found when the metallic or organic substrate were treated by APPJ in their experiments.',\n",
       "  'Sheath is one of the oldest problems in plasma studies (Langmuir1913; Tonks and Langmuir1929; Child1911). It presents as a layer of electrons or ions close to the surface to balance the surface charges, produced by the bipolar diffusion process of electrons and positive ions in plasma (Lieberman and Lichtenberg2005). Sheath generates an electric field at the plasma–surface boundary, balancing the ion and electron currents entering the surface, and it also acts as an insulator between the hot electrons and the surface, profoundly affecting the physical characteristics of the plasma near the surface (Taccogna et al.2004). Properties of sheath are relative to secondary electron emission. Schwager et al. indicated that the surface secondary electron emission process can cause the sheath potential to drop by approximately 2.6 times, with the degree of reduction related to the magnitude of the surface electron emission current (i.e. the secondary electron emission coefficient) (Schwager et al.1993). Seon et al.’s (2012) numerical simulation results showed that a relatively small range of secondary electron emission coefficients can ensure the stability of the sheath structure. Langendorf experimentally measured the plasma sheath potential distribution on a boron nitride wall in an Ar-plasma and observed the influence of secondary electron emission, finding that the sheath thickness was 20–50\\xa0mm, with a thinner sheath in the region of secondary electron emission (Langendorf and Walker2015).',\n",
       "  'In the study of APPJ–surface interactions, the sheath affects the surface electric field and alters the charge distribution near the surface. Wang et al. conducted experiments and simulations on APPJ treated surfaces. Their results show that when the volume ionizing wave sheath produced by the APPJ inhibits the ionizing wave from continuing to develop towards the surface, thus converting the surface ionizing wave into the surrounding development (Wang et al.2024b). When the treated surface is tilted, the cathode sheath formed on the side near the jet tube port is thinner, so the surface charge density is higher. The N, O flux to the surface also increases (Wang et al.2024c). In addition, for some microstructures, the presence of a sheath limits the entry of electrical discharge. Fu et al. pointed out that during plasma microdischarge, the sheath thickness would limit the discharge scale, thus affecting the plasma discharge characteristics. Their numerical simulations demonstrate that the sheath thickness decreases significantly when the length-to-diameter ratio of the surface protrusions increases (Fu et al.2018). Jiang et al. studied the wavy surface treated by APPJ with different curvature radii through numerical simulation. They found that when the radius of curvature of the surface protrusions is 80\\xa0μm, the thickness of the sheath can reach 260\\xa0μm, which is much larger than the diameter of the depression (160\\xa0μm). At this time, due to the existence of the sheath, the discharge cannot enter the interior of the depression. The plasma plume only reaches above the surface, resulting in uneven treatment (Jiang et al.2023b).',\n",
       "  'It can be seen that secondary electron emission and sheath are important physical processes near the surface. They can significantly affect the electric field, charge distribution near the surface, and thus the flux of species into the surface. In practical applications, the surface active substance flux will affect the surface reaction and treatment effect, so secondary electron emission and sheath are often paid attention to in the study of surface treatment. The thickness of sheath may be affected by different surface geometry, target distance, and discharge power. Different surface properties also alter the secondary electron emission process. Therefore, the changes of secondary electron emission and sheath layer reflect the parameter sensitivity of APPJ–surface interaction to some extent.',\n",
       "  'Reactions happening on the surface are also important part of plasma chemistry. Some species in bulk plasma would be quenched and new species would be generated on the surface. Moreover, chemistry of surface would be modified in this process. Surface reactions are also important processes that affects the surface treatment effect of APPJ.',\n",
       "  'Before surface reactions happen, species are first adsorbed onto the surface through physical adsorption and chemical adsorption. Physical adsorption is a reversible process, with the bonds between the adsorbed substance and the surface formed due to van der Waals forces (Viegas et al.2024). Unlike physical adsorption, chemisorption is an irreversible process (Viegas et al.2024). During chemisorption, a true chemical bond (covalent or ionic bond) forms between the adsorbed atoms or molecules and the surface. Due to the high energy of chemical bonds, it is difficult to achieve thermal desorption (above 2000\\xa0K) in the application scenarios of low-temperature plasma surface treatment (Kim and Boudart2002). Therefore, species chemisorbed on the surface can only leave the surface by reacting with gaseous species. When molecules with multiple bonds undergo chemisorption, one of the chemical bonds in the molecule breaks and forms a chemical bond with the surface as shown in:',\n",

The actual surface adsorption process is quite complex, with both physical adsorption and chemisorption often occurring simultaneously. The strength and the dominance of each process are related to the surface temperature and conditions. Marinov et al. (2016) calculated the interaction process between plasma and the surface based on the kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) algorithm and pointed out that there is a certain spatial distribution of surface activity and energy. Different energy levels lead to different adsorption processes.

The reaction process is:',\n",
       "  'In addition to reactions caused by direct collisions, the E–R reaction mechanism has an “indirect” situation. When a gaseous particle collides with the surface and physically adsorbs at a location far from the second chemisorbed particle, if the gaseous particle gains some energy during the adsorption process and the energy is sufficient to overcome the diffusion energy barrier, the physically adsorbed particle will diffuse to the location of the second chemisorbed particle and eventually react with it (Cacciatore and Rutigliano2009). This reaction mechanism was first proposed by Rideal in 1939, and its physicochemical properties are significantly different from those of the “direct” collision E–R reaction mechanism.',\n",
       "  'Considering the different reaction mechanisms of the L–H and E–R reactions, their proportion in surface reactions is significantly related to the surface temperature. It is generally believed that the L–H reaction mechanism dominates in the medium temperature range. At low temperatures, due to the low surface diffusion coefficient and high surface position coverage, the L–H reaction mechanism may be hindered. At higher temperatures, the surface desorption rate is higher, and the adsorption rate of species on the surface may be insufficient. Therefore, it is expected that the direct collision E–R reaction mechanism will dominate in high-temperature environments (Cacciatore and Rutigliano2009).',\n",
       "  'In the relevant studies of APPJ surface treatment, the actual surface reactions that occur are more complex. Based on the above basic mechanism, the reactants involved in the reaction and the reaction rate depend on the chemical composition of the surface, the spatial distribution of the reactive species in the plasma, and the surface temperature. For example, simulation study of Norberg et al. showed that when APPJ treated water surfaces, a large amount of OH would be formed near the liquid surface due to the evaporation of water (Norberg et al.2016,2014). This means that there will be more OH fluxes near the surface of the liquid, and the surface chemistry will obviously change as a result. In addition, the density of reactive species distributed in the volume discharge and surface discharge regions is different. O and N2+have high densities in SIWs, while OH is mainly distributed in the plume (Norberg et al.2015b). In the study of APPJ–surface interactions, surface reactions are usually generalized by some known reactants. Relevant studies on plasma–surface reactions also provide information such as reaction formula and rate coefficient for the construction of such models (Booth et al.2019,2023; Dias et al.2023). However, most of the current models adopt deterministic models characterized by reaction equations and reaction rates. The advantage of this type of kinetic model is its simplicity and good coupling with plasma dynamics models. However, accurate results can only be obtained by understanding all the important reactions in the surface chemical process and their quantified reaction rates, which is obviously unrealistic for complex surface chemistry. Marinov et al. introduced Monte Carlo simulation into the model of surface reactions, to some extent restoring the uncertainty of surface adsorption and chemical reactions in actual situations. However, this is only limited to optimizing the uncertainty of the adsorption process, and the actual chemical process of the surface still lacks description based on chemical knowledge(Marinov et al.2016). In recent years, molecular dynamics models and density functional theory (DFT) have been widely used in materials science, and related plasma research has also adopted these models to accurately describe the chemical and biological processes in space and on the surface (Li et al.2022; Yusupov et al.2015; Longo et al.2020). These microscopic models fully restore the microstructure of the surface, and DFT even introduces quantum effects to obtain accurate reaction mechanism models, which can be more widely applied to complex and diverse surface and gas environments and obtain more accurate results. However, the complex algorithms make the calculation step of these models quite short, generally at the picosecond (ps) level, which is difficult to couple with the time step of plasma dynamics models. The complexity of the microstructure also makes the adjustment of the model very difficult, and the cost of model calculation will also increase significantly.',\n",
       "  'Overall, existing research has basically described the important reaction mechanisms in surface chemistry, but there is still a contradiction between accuracy and speed in the construction of surface chemical kinetics models in the plasma–surface process. The current concern of researchers is how to introduce accurate chemical knowledge while ensuring the good coupling between the plasma dynamics model and the surface chemical model, i.e., to achieve the whole-process simulation of fluid–surface chemistry. In addition, there is also a contradiction between the accuracy and universality of the surface dynamics model. To expand the predictive range of the model and improve its accuracy, further investigation of the surface chemistry in complex systems is needed.',\n",
       "  'In surface treatment with APPJ, energy and active material flux are simultaneously transferred to the surface. The energy exchange that occurs during this process allows the surface temperature to be removed from the thermal equilibrium in the gas, forming a local thermal equilibrium (Tomko et al.2022). The energy transferred in this process enables surface etching, deposition, and modification. Surface temperature is a reflection of energy exchange between surface and gas. Kersten et al. summarized the energy exchange process during surface treatment by plasma. They suggest that surface heating can be described by the balance of surface energy fluxes. The energy absorbed by the surface includes the energy radiated to the surface and the energy carried by the active substance. The energy released by the surface includes the energy released by surface adsorption and the energy released by surface reaction (Kersten et al.2001). The temperature, is in fact, the net result of the difference between energy delivered to and released from the surface.',\n",
       "  'In some application studies, the surface temperature changes after APPJ treatment were measured. Lee et al. used APPJ to treat polystyrene substrates. The measured results of surface temperature show that the surface temperature of untreated substrate is 18.5 ℃ and rises to 21.9 ℃ after treatment, an increase of about 3\\xa0℃ (Lee et al.2013). Nascimento et al. measured PP surface temperatures before and 10\\xa0min after the PP surface was treated by APPJ. They observed a surface temperature change of less than 1\\xa0℃. Moreover, when the discharge generated by the APPJ diffuses on the surface, the heat energy transferred to the surface decreases with the increase of the diffusion radius. They believe that surface heating has little effect on the treatment effect of PP surface (Nascimento et al.2022).',\n",
       "  \"Mance et al. studied the process of heat transfer from APPJ to the target surface based on the safety of medical application of APPJ. They discussed the effects of surface to APPJ port distance, gas flow rate, and plasma plume length on the energy transferred to the surface. The results show that the distance from the APPJ to the surface has the most significant effect on the energy flux transferred to the surface, and this effect is non-linear. At low flow velocity (2 slm), when the distance between APPJ and the surface is relatively close (2\\xa0mm), the energy flux transferred to the surface can reach about 700 mW (Mance et al.2018). Based on the ns time-resolved precision temperature measuring equipment, Tomko et al. studied the heating and transient cooling processes of the gold surface respectively by the energy flux of APPJ. The TTM calculation results show that the flux heating of the surface of Au is the main mechanism of energy transfer, and the energy is mainly dissipated by conduction to the material. The experimental results show that the plasma jet induces transient cooling of the gold surface before heating. This cooling is related to the photon flux before the charged species flux. They believe that the photon flux releases surface adsorbers from the gold, temporarily cooling the metal surface. During steady-state operation, this process is often overwhelmed by the heating of the material's surface, making it difficult to detect (Tomko et al.2022).\",\n",
       "  'In general, the process of surface heating is formed under the joint action of various energy exchange processes. The surface temperature change for the medium surface treatment is often more limited, generally in the range of a few degrees Celsius. This shows that APPJ is suitable for handling heat-sensitive materials. It should be noted that the surface temperature is closely related to the distance of the APPJ from the surface. The discharge transition process that may occur when the distance is too close may also cause the temperature to run out of control. When dealing with biological objects, the breathing and movement of biological objects may cause changes in the distance between APPJ and the object, which is a challenge for the control of surface temperature.',\n",
       "  'Bulk discharges, surface discharges, RONS, surface reactions, gas, and surface heating described in Sect.3have different effects in practical application scenarios. When APPJ treats surfaces, the above basic processes act alone or together to ultimately achieve the purpose of material treatment or biomedical treatment. This section will explain the practical application of APPJ in surface treatment from both material handling and biomedical perspectives. The description in this section continues from the basic process. In material treatment, surface grafting polymerization, surface deposition, and etching, which are three commonly used material processing processes, are introduced in this paper. In the biomedical part, this paper will focus on the influence of electric field, penetration effect, treatment of cancer cells, microbial inactivation, and blood coagulation.',\n",
       "  'The application of plasma to material treatment has been studied for a long time. Surface energy is a very important physical quantity in surface treatment. It represents the reactivity of the surface. Review by Booth et al. indicated that surface functionalization by atmospheric pressure plasma can: (1) increase surface energy (i.e. surface activation); (2) reducing surface energy (i.e., surface passivation); (3) introducing new functional groups to surfaces (Booth et al.2022). From APPJ treatment, some new chemical groups may be introduced to the surface through surface reactions, which is surface grafting. Under specific treatment conditions, APPJ can form a thin film on the surface, thereby changing the surface energy and surface properties, which is surface deposition. In addition, specific active molecules can also cause damage to the surface, which is surface etching. By grafting, deposition, and etching, APPJ is able to perform specific treatments on the surface of the material to achieve changes in surface properties.',\n",
       "  'Surface grafting refers to the process of modifying surface chemical properties by introducing functional groups (Zhang et al.2018). Booth et al. (2022) described this process as surface functionalization, emphasizing that it focuses on changes in the surface’s outermost chemical properties rather than the amount of material deposited. Plasma-based surface grafting and polymerization have been developed for decades, allowing selective modification of surface properties (e.g. oxidation/reduction, hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity) without altering the underlying material, a capability not easily achieved by other surface modification methods.',\n",
       "  'Plasma surface grafting processes generally fall into two categories: “grafting from” and “grafting onto” (Zhang et al.2018) as illustrated in Fig.11. “Grafting from” involves generating reactive sites on the surface through plasma treatment and introducing functionalized groups, typically determined by the gas atmosphere. For example, exposure to O2plasma introduces carboxyl (–COOH) and hydroxyl (–OH) groups, while inert gases (He and Ar) create reactive sites through etching (Mirabedini et al.2007). CF4in the gas atmosphere introduces F elements for hydrophobic modification (Wang et al.2015). In grafting from, the introduced chemical groups are determined by the gas atmosphere. In contrast, grafting onto requires pre-adsorption of monomers on the surface, followed by plasma treatment to graft the adsorbed monomers onto the surface. Kuzuya et al. (2003) achieved this by soaking hydrophobic PE films in a VEMA solution, adsorbing VEMA onto the PE surface, and then inducing crosslinking reactions through Ar plasma treatment to form a polymer containing maleic anhydride on the PE surface. The Ar plasma primarily acted as a catalyst for crosslinking polymerization, without affecting the introduced chemical groups, distinguishing it from “grafting from”. “Grafting from” typically introduces higher densities of functional groups due to the higher density of functional monomers in the atmosphere and the steric hindrance effect of larger, adsorbed monomers in “grafting onto” (Xue et al.2017).',\n",

       "  'Surface hydrophilic and hydrophobic modifications are typical applications of surface grafting. The hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity of material surfaces is closely related to various specific applications, such as material compounding, printability, and film deposition. The hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity of material surfaces is often evaluated by measuring the water contact angle (WCA), which involves placing a droplet on the film surface and measuring the angle between the tangent line of the droplet side and the film surface. Generally, the water contact angle of the film surface is considered as a critical point at 90°, with angles greater than 90° indicating hydrophobicity and angles less than 90° indicating hydrophilicity.',\n",
       "  'The modification of surface wettability using APPJs technology has been extensively explored. Introducing hydrophilic properties is generally achieved by incorporating oxygen-containing functional groups, which do not need additional precursors. Kim et al. utilized APPJ to treat stainless steel surfaces with a mixed air atmosphere (N2:O2=\\u20094:1), a driving voltage of 10\\xa0kV, and a frequency of 16–20\\xa0kHz. The treated surfaces exhibited a significant decrease in water contact angle from 50° to 10°. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) results indicated that chemical bonds such as Fe–O and C–O were formed on the surface (Kim et al.2003). Fang et al. explored the effects of Ar–APPJ treatment on the surface properties of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) films and observed a reduction in water contact angle from approximately 75° to 35°. They found that shorter treatment distances or higher discharge powers resulted in greater reductions in water contact angle. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and XPS characterization revealed the grafting of OH, C–O–C and C=O, suggesting that the introduction of oxygen was the primary cause of increased surface hydrophilicity (Fang et al.2013). Liu et al. enhanced the hydrophilic modification of PTFE by increasing the OH content in the plasma region through adjusting the environmental humidity. They found that when the water content was 6\\xa0mg/L, the OH density reached its maximum, while the O atoms gradually decreased. At this point, more oxygen-containing polar groups were injected into the surface, and the etching effect of the plasma was the strongest, resulting in a water contact angle of 37°. However, the etching effect could negatively impact surface hydrophilicity. When the water content was 2.3\\xa0mg/L, the OH yield was higher, but the water contact angle remained relatively high due to excessive etching (Liu et al.2018b).',\n",
       "  'Hydrophobic modification necessitates the introduction of other elements, such as silicon (Si), and fluorine (F), hence the need for appropriate precursors to facilitate grafting. In APPJ treatment, precursors can be easily mixed into working gas. For instance, Liu et al. utilized an APPJ array under an Ar/Tetramethylsilane (TMS) atmosphere to introduce silicon into Poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) surfaces, enhancing their hydrophobicity. With 0.04% TMS content in the working gas, a 240\\xa0s plasma treatment increased the PMMA surface water contact angle from 65° to 115°. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) revealed the presence of particle clusters with diameters up to several hundred nanometers on the plasma-treated PMMA surface. Fourier-Transform Infrared (FTIR) and X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) characterizations demonstrated that silicon-containing groups like Si–CH3, Si–H, and Si–O–Si replaced the oxygen-containing hydrophilic polar groups (C–O and C=O), thereby enhancing surface hydrophobicity (Liu et al.2018c). Xu et al. focused on hydrophobic modification of non-planar structures using APPJ. They compared the differences in hydrophobic treatment between planar and cylindrical ceramic surfaces using polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) as the precursor mixed with Ar as the working gas. They found that surface superhydrophobic modification could be achieved at a treatment distance of 10–20\\xa0mm. Despite differences in the shape of the treated surface area between planar and cylindrical surfaces, significant non-uniformity was observed in both cases (Xu et al.2023).',\n",
       "  'Generally speaking, grafting by APPJs can modify surface properties by introducing functional groups. The modification effects are closely related to the driving power source, atmosphere, treatment duration, and working parameters (Zhang and Chen2021). Grafting with APPJ can be done directly by mixing specific species into the working gas. Compared with the traditional treatment method, treatment by APPJs is more convenient and mild. However, it is important to note that plasma surface treatment on polymer surfaces generally results in temporary functional modification and surface energy changes, which diminish over time, a phenomenon known as the “aging effect” (Cheng et al.2010). Typically, the treated surface returns to its original state after a few days of exposure. This property hinders the further application of plasma grafting but remains valuable for surface pre-treatment and providing reactive sites for subsequent reactions.',\n",
       "  'Plasma deposition is also a common method for depositing semiconductors, carbon materials, metals, and metal oxides on material surfaces (Liang et al.2018). Compared to traditional thermal deposition methods, plasma deposition allows for more flexible selection of processing conditions (such as surface temperature, processing time, etc.) and has been widely used in the semiconductor processing industry due to its green, non-toxic, and low surface temperature characteristics(Zhang and Chen2021).',\n",
       "  'Plasma deposition primarily encompasses two technological routes: plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) and plasma-enhanced atomic layer deposition (PEALD). PECVD involves the deposition of functional thin films on material surfaces through plasma-induced chemical reactions of precursors, achieving functionalization of the substrate surface. The presence of numerous active components in the plasma greatly facilitates the reaction, conferring advantages, such as low reaction temperature, fast deposition rate, and high film quality. Atomic layer deposition (ALD) enables the preparation of uniform, ultra-thin, and conformal thin films with precisely controllable composition and thickness at the atomic level. Compared to the traditional thermal ALD (T-ALD) method, the PAALD process effectively reduces the deposition temperature of the film, making it suitable for temperature-sensitive deposition processes. PAALD is currently widely used in the preparation of high-quality ultra-thin films for microelectronics, catalysis, and new energy applications (Zhang et al.2018).',\n",
       "  'Although atmospheric pressure plasmas are less uniform compared to low-pressure plasmas (Bornholdt et al.2010), APPJs exhibit unique advantages in surface deposition processes, particularly for localized thin film deposition or 3D surfaces, such as the inner walls of recesses or deep grooves. Moreover, since the surface to be treated does not need to be placed between electrodes during APPJ treating, treatment distance and electric field control are more flexible (Schäfer et al.2008). Additionally, the surface temperature of the target surface treated by APPJ is generally within a controllable range, such as 35–90\\xa0℃ for polymer surfaces (Foest et al.2005), making it suitable for temperature-sensitive materials like paper and biological materials. These characteristics make APPJs a viable technique for specific application scenarios in plasma deposition.',\n",
       "  'There have been numerous attempts to apply APPJs in plasma deposition processes. Schafer et al. investigated the deposition of SiOxon flat polymer and glass surfaces using the RF-driven APPJ with an atmosphere of Ar\\u2009+\\u20091% HMDSO ((CH3)SiOSi(CH3)3), achieving a film deposition rate of 0.25–23\\xa0nm/s. The performance of the film was evaluated under different deposition conditions and substrate distances using profilometry, XPS, FTIR spectroscopy, and SEM. FTIR spectroscopy indicated that the film’s main component was SiOx, with no CH2absorption, suggesting complete decomposition of HMDSO. Overall, the deposition of 3D structures was found to be related to the distance between the jet and the surface and the direction of the jet (Schäfer et al.2008). Kong et al. proposed a method for depositing TiCxOyNzfilms on the surfaces of insulating materials using 20\\xa0kHz AC–APPJ. Ar was used to pump the precursor tetraethyl orthotitanate (TTEO) into the plasma jet chamber, with N2as the working gas. The results showed that the secondary electron yield (SEY) of the samples coated with TiCxOyNzfilm decreased to 1.5, and the breakdown voltage of the samples was significantly improved (Kong et al.2020). Zhu et al. addressed the issue of reduced insulation caused by trace metal defects at the Cu/EP interface using a precision surface treatment method based on mini-APPJ with a diameter of approximately 200\\xa0μm. Ar/HMDSO–APPJ deposition around μm-scale defects improved the interfacial electrical performance of the defective Cu/EP samples, resulting in higher flashover voltage and suppressed partial discharge. Figure12a shows the flashover photographs of the Cu/EP defective samples before and after APPJ treatment, demonstrating the significant increase in flashover voltage with film deposition on the defects. Figure12b–d presents the Weibull distribution of flashover voltage before and after APPJ treatment, indicating that defect introduction severely affected surface electrical insulation. However, with increased HMDSO addition, flashover voltage initially increased and then slightly decreased, indicating improved surface electrical insulation after plasma treatment. Additionally, increased processing time generally shifted the curve to the right, suggesting enhanced electrical performance (Zhu et al.2023). Overall, surface deposition via APPJs is mainly achieved by mixing a precursor solution into the working gas. The substance in the precursor solution follows the air flow to the surface after atomization and participates in the surface reaction, thus achieving surface deposition. The fluidity of APPJs enables it to structure complex 3D surfaces, demonstrating the advantages of APPJ surface deposition.',\n",

       "  'It is evident that APPJs possess the capability of depositing corresponding films on surfaces, primarily applied in the PECVD technology route. There have been no reports on the application of APPJ in PAALD mainly because ALD film formation requires higher precision and control, and the freely flowing APPJ under atmospheric pressure is difficult to achieve such uniform film deposition. Kong et al. (2020) also pointed out that APPJ introduces rough surfaces to materials, indicating potential issues with deposition uniformity. However, the open environment operation, low temperature, and flexible operation of APPJ still hold significant application potential in deposition processes.',\n",
       "  'Plasma etching is one of the primary applications of plasma technology and widely used in the production of semiconductor devices for processing trenches on semiconductor surfaces or removing excess material components (e.g., photoresist). This technique, also known as dry etching, differs from traditional wet etching methods that require toxic chemicals and corrosive acids/bases, resulting in harsh operating conditions that pose health risks to operators and severe environmental pollution. Consequently, wet etching has been gradually replaced by plasma etching (Zhang and Chen2021). Plasma etching relies heavily on the reaction between plasma and the target surface, where the surface material is decomposed into volatile compounds after the reaction and removed (Liang et al.2018).',\n",
       "  'Currently, plasma etching processes in industrial applications typically employ low-pressure plasmas due to their advantages of uniform discharge, high particle energy, and controllable chemical processes. These processes include four fundamental mechanisms for removing surface materials: sputtering, pure chemical etching, ion energy-driven etching, and ion-barrier layer composite etching, and can achieve anisotropic etching with chemical selectivity (Lieberman and Lichtenberg2005). However, low-pressure plasma etching also has several drawbacks. First, the vacuum equipment is expensive, increasing complexity and cost of the processing. Second, the intense plasma discharge can cause unintended damage to the target surface, with the strong electric field of the surface sheath potentially damaging sensitive semiconductor components. Moreover, the ion bombardment of the surface due to the acceleration of ions through the sheath can lead to wafer sputtering and physical damage. With the shrinking feature size, this ion bombardment may cause irreparable damage to the wafer structure (West et al.2016). Considering these issues, APPJs have received increasing attention as a novel surface etching technique in recent years. APPJs can be directly applied in open atmospheric environments, and its lower surface temperature can avoid surface damage caused by high temperatures (Wang et al.2016). Additionally, APPJ etching utilizes downstream plasma-active chemical species, avoiding the contact of high-energy particles with the target surface, thus preventing damage to the wafer from ion bombardment and other processes (West et al.2016).',\n",
       "  'In 1998, Jeong et al. explored surface etching using an RF-driven APPJ device and found that it could achieve etching rates of 1.0–8.0\\u2009±\\u20090.2\\xa0μm/min for polyimide surfaces, emphasizing the dominant role of O atoms in this process (Jeong et al.1999b). Subsequently, they explored etching rates on different material surfaces under the same conditions. With a RF power range of 50–500 W, a fixed distance of 5\\xa0mm between the jet outlet and the material, and a working gas of He/O2/CF4, they discovered that APPJ exhibited different etching rates on various material surfaces: 8.0\\xa0μm/min for Kapton plastic (using only He and O2as the working gas), 1.5\\xa0μm/min for SiO2, 2.0\\xa0μm/min for tantalum, and 1.0\\xa0μm/min for tungsten (Jeong et al.1999a). Their study demonstrated the feasibility of APPJs for surface etching. West et al. utilized RF-driven APPJ to etch photoresist on silicon wafers with a working gas of He/O2and observed a maximum removal rate of 10\\xa0μm/min, which is 100 times higher than that of typical low-pressure methods. However, ATR-FTIR evaluation revealed that the etching quality was equivalent to that of low-pressure plasma etching, and TALIF measurements indicated that the photoresist removal rate was directly related to the surface flux of O atoms (West et al.2016). Wang et al. investigated the etching effects of kHz AC-driven APPJ on photoresist, comparing the etching results of different electrode structures. The results showed that after APPJ treatment, the photoresist surface exhibited a granular structure accompanied by a large number of particles, with the highest etching rate at the center of the etching area and gradually decreasing towards the edge of the etching area. Furthermore, the needle-ring electrode APPJ had the highest etching rate but was prone to damaging the silicon wafer, while the double-ring electrode APPJ was the most stable but required a longer processing time to achieve the desired result. Etching rate and result of the multi-electrode APPJ were between the two. Additionally, Ar–APPJ had a higher etching rate and more irregular etching traces than He–APPJ. Moreover, the effective etching area increased first and then decreased with the increase in the distance from the plasma jet outlet to the PR surface (Wang et al.2016). Knoll et al. found that RF-driven APPJ tends to produce etching effects on surfaces, while surface microdischarge (SMD) at atmospheric pressure usually tends to achieve surface functionalization. This difference is related to the apparent activation energies of the two sources. They also found that the etching behavior of APPJs exhibited anisotropy at a source-to-surface distance of 8\\xa0mm, with the anisotropy weakening with increasing distance (Knoll et al.2018).',\n",
       "  'The above studies indicate that the potential for surface etching applications of APPJs and the etching effects is influenced by factors, such as gas environment, processing distance, and surface conditions, allowing for flexible control. However, potential chemical corrosion and oxidation issues in open atmospheric environments during semiconductor processing cannot be ignored. Moreover, challenges related to large-area processing and uniformity remain for APPJ etching in industrial applications.',\n",
       "  'Research on the impact of electric fields on cells dates back to the 1970s. Jaffe et al. (1977) summarized previous studies in 1977, noting reports indicating that animal and plant cells respond to electric fields. Subsequent research shifted from direct current to pulsed electric fields, demonstrating their efficacy in influencing and regulating cellular physiological activities (Shan et al.2020; Liu et al.2018d; Neumann et al.1982). Initially, cell death was observed, leading to the hypothesis that dielectric breakdown caused membrane rupture due to the internal insulating layer of the cell membrane, a phenomenon known as “electroporation (IRE)” (Schoenbach et al.2000; Sale and Hamilton1968; Weaver2000). Sale et al. (1968) estimated the voltage required for irreversible cell death to be approximately 1\\xa0V. Biological membrane electroporation has applications in various medical fields. It enables the delivery of species previously unable to enter cells, enhancing the efficacy of drugs, particularly anticancer agents (Liu et al.2018d; Schoenbach et al.1997). Researchers have also proposed ex vivo therapies involving drug delivery into leukocytes followed by transfusion into patients (Weaver2000; Bruggemann et al.1995). Electroporation can also be utilized in gene therapy, allowing DNA entry into cells (Schoenbach et al.2002a). However, this method’s efficiency is not superior to traditional methods and remains unimplemented (Dev et al.2000).',\n",
       "  'Electric field effects also depend on voltage amplitude and pulse width. At low fields (several kV/cm) and long pulse widths (0.1–10\\xa0ms), electroporation occurs when membrane voltage drops within 0.1 to 1\\xa0V. At intracellular fields of tens of kV/cm and short durations (10–100\\xa0ns), dielectric breakdown does not occur, leading to intracellular electromanipulation (Schoenbach et al.2002b,2001; Beebe et al.2002). Vernier et al. (2004) showed that strong short-pulse electric fields create nanopores, facilitating molecule and ion transport through intact cell membranes. Napotnik et al. (2012) demonstrated that short, intense electric fields enhance mitochondrial membrane permeability. Morotomi-Yano et al. (2011) observed activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPKs) pathways by short, intense electric fields, affecting cellular communication. These findings highlight the influence of field strength and pulse width on cellular effects, with short, intense fields affecting intracellular structures and long, weak fields promoting membrane electroporation.',\n",
       "  \"APPJ also transmits an electric field to downstream cells. This electric field transfer process is closely related to SIWs. Norberg et al. developed a numerical model for APPJ processing fluid-covered biological tissue. The changes of electric field on the tissue surface of APPJ when the plume does not touch the surface at low voltage and when the plume touches the surface at high voltage are compared. In the uncontacted case, the electric field on the tissue surface at the end of the discharge is only 1\\xa0kV/cm. In the case where the applied voltage is -20\\xa0kV and the plume touches the surface, the electric field on the tissue surface can reach 17\\xa0kV/cm, which is close to the threshold of electroporation. Therefore, they suggested that APPJ could induce electroporation at higher pulse repetition rates (Norberg et al.2014). But their subsequent research pointed out that while pulsed APPJ produced a threshold electric field intensity in the cell membrane, cytoplasm, and nucleus, its duration was only a few tens of ns as shown in the figure. Electroporation cannot be triggered if the electric field duration is short. Under the conditions they studied, APPJ was more likely to cause intracellular electromanipulation, affecting the organelles within the cell. In addition, a very short duration of strong electric field may lead to a large number of nanopores on the membrane surface, affecting the transmembrane transport process without damaging the membrane structure (Norberg et al.2016). Chen et al. further simulated the changes in the internal electric field when APPJ treated cells. They combined APPJ's fluid model with the asymptotic Smoluchowski model. The nanopore on the surface of the membrane is equivalent to a new current channel, so when electroporation occurs, the conductivity of the membrane structure increases, which affects the charge distribution on the surface. They discussed two substrates, medium and epidermis, in which the cells are placed. After APPJ reaches the target surface, the electric field inside the cell changes with the formation and development of SIWs. The results are shown in the figure. In both substrates, the electric field transmitted by APPJ to cells leads to the generation of nanopore, and the time of electroporation is related to the dielectric constant of the substrate. Electroporation of nuclear membrane occurs earlier, and the number of nanopores is much larger than that of cell membrane (Chen et al.2024). These studies all show that APPJ can generate electric fields of sufficient intensity on the surface of the tissue to induce electroporation. The electric field in the cell is propagated downward by surface ionizing waves and is therefore also associated with the process by which surface ionizing waves spread across the surface.\",\n",

However, when gaseous reactive species generated by plasma enter an aqueous solution, they can produce a variety of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (RONS) in the liquid phase, such as H2O2, NO2−, NO3−, and short-lived species like OH. These liquid-phase RONS are the main effector molecules for plasma action on biological cells or tissues (Liu et al.2015; Tian and Kushner2014).',\n",
       "  'Some research perspectives suggest that plasma medicine is limited to the human surface (Szili et al.2010), but recent research results indicate that the action depth of reactive species is not limited to this. Using water as a simplified model of human tissue, studies by Liu et al. (2015) and Tian et al. (2014) have shown that although most reactive species produced by plasma have a short survival time and shallow penetration depth, complex chemical reactions occur at the gas–liquid interface and within the liquid, resulting in the re-generation of short-lived species in the deeper layers of the solution, thus penetrating to deeper areas. Ran et al. (2024a,b) utilized this chemical mechanism of generating short-lived reactive species in the liquid phase to prepare plasma-activated water that can be stored for an extended period. Studies using hydrogels as tissue models have shown that the penetration depth of H2O2produced by plasma can exceed 1.5\\xa0mm, and the penetration depth of reactive species is influenced by factors, such as treatment time and airflow (Szili et al.2014). Additionally, animal experiments by Keidar et al. (2011) found that plasma can penetrate the skin to kill cancer cells in subcutaneous tissues of nude mice, indicating that the biomedical effects produced by plasma can penetrate through the epidermis to the subcutaneous layer.',\n",
       "  'Current research results suggest that the pathways for plasma penetration into biological tissues may include: first, reactive species enter biological tissues through gas diffusion, for example, He et al. (2017) found that helium gas blowing can promote the penetration of NO2−when treating gelatin hydrogels with He–APPJ, mainly because helium, a small molecule, can penetrate into the gel and squeeze to promote the penetration of NO2−. Second, long-lived reactive species penetrate into the tissue environment, produce chemical reactions, and generate important short-lived species in situ to achieve the penetration of reactive species. Third, plasma may expand its action range and achieve deep penetration through physiological effects. For example, Fridman et al. found that a certain dose of plasma treatment can effectively improve the migration ability of macrophages and their ability to kill cancer cells (Miller et al.2014; Lin et al.2015).',\n",

Conventional treatments for malignant melanoma have limitations due to chemotherapy resistance, metastasis, and a lack of novel effective therapies (Terefinko et al.2021). However, researchers have found that cold plasma demonstrates effective killing of melanoma cells. Xu et al. evaluated the effects of AC-driven He–APPJ on cultured mouse melanoma cells and fibroblasts in vitro. Cell viability, apoptosis, and DNA damage assays revealed that plasma could inactivate melanoma cells within 10–60\\xa0s. In contrast, fibroblasts showed significant changes after 30–60\\xa0s of plasma treatment, with lower cytotoxicity compared to melanoma cells treated for the same duration (Xu et al.2017). This suggests that the APPJ selectively damages melanoma cells without harming normal cells. Further research by Xu et al. compared the damage mechanisms of APPJ on cultured malignant melanoma cells at different treatment durations. They assessed the types of reactive species in the cell culture medium, as well as biochemical indicators such as cell viability, cell morphology, DNA damage, intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), and antioxidant capacity. The results showed a significant increase in H2O2and NO2−in the cell culture medium after APPJ treatment. Cell viability, intracellular total antioxidant capacity, and glutathione (GSH) content decreased compared to untreated cells, with more pronounced reductions with longer treatment durations. As the plasma treatment time increased from 30 to 90\\xa0s, intracellular malondialdehyde (MDA), ROS content, and cell damage severity significantly increased. These findings indicate that the mechanism of APPJ-induced damage in melanoma cancer cells primarily involves the generation of ROS induced by reactive nitrogen and oxygen species (RONS) produced in the gas and liquid phases, ultimately leading to oxidative stress-induced damage to cellular components (Xu et al.2018). Muneekaew et al. quantitatively evaluated the effects of APPJ on cell viability and morphology of human melanoma cells, Lewis lung cancer cells, and mouse fibroblasts. The results demonstrated that under the same experimental conditions, APPJ selectively damaged melanoma cells by triggering apoptosis, inhibiting the growth of melanoma cells and the metastasis of Lewis lung cancer, while having no inhibitory effect on the growth of normal cells (mouse fibroblasts). Flow cytometry results showed that apoptosis of melanoma cells increased with elevated caspase-9 activity. Additionally, apoptosis of Lewis lung cancer cells increased after APPJ treatment in the absence of caspase-9 involvement (Muneekaew et al.2021). These studies suggest that APPJ treatment selectively damages melanoma cells, providing a potential solution for skin cancer treatment.\",\n",
       "  'The selective killing effect of APPJ, or low-temperature plasma, on cancer cells is still being investigated. RONS clearly played an important role in this process. Jo et al. have shown that plasma-activated vectors (PAM) also have a killing effect on cancer cells. Considering that the effect of PAM is mainly realized through the RONS inside the vector, without electric field and radiation effects, it can be considered that RONS alone can inactivate cancer cells (Jo et al.2022). Graves et al. noted that in addition to the RONS produced by the plasma itself, the plasma also induces the cell to produce reactive species, such as HO2, O2-, NO, OH, and H2O2. Among the numerous RONS, O, O3, and O2-all have significant effects on cells. O2(1Δg) as mentioned in 2.1.2 is considered to be a key substance in the selective killing of cancer cells (Chen et al.2022). In addition to killing cancer cells directly by way of oxidative damage, these RONS can also affect cancer cells through cell cycle regulation. For example, RONS can cause cell cycle stagnation, which prevents cancer cells from proliferating. Alternatively, they can activate the apoptosis pathway, enabling apoptosis of cancer cells (Muneekaew et al.2021). However, in this process, the plasma-killing effect on cancer cells has little effect on normal cells. This selectivity is mainly due to the fact that normal cells have stronger antioxidant capacity than cancer cells and are able to resist the oxidative stress caused by RONS (Keidar2015).',\n",
       "  'It can be seen that plasmas have been repeatedly shown to have the ability to selectively kill cancer cells. But the study of its mechanism and selectivity is still ongoing. Further in vitro, in vivo, and even clinical trials will help to understand this mechanism. Before further clinical application, the tolerance of normal cells to plasma and the dose control of plasma also need to be clarified. Plasma cancer therapy is a complex medical issue, which is briefly summarized here based on only a few review papers. Interested readers are referred to the review papers by Keidar et al. (2015), Woedtke et al. (2020), and Chen et al. (2022).',\n",
       "  'Plasma has been demonstrated to effectively inactivate bacteria, fungi, and viruses through mechanisms, such as UV-induced mutagenesis, electric field effects, and reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (RONS)-mediated chemical reactions, that disrupt cellular structures (e.g., membranes) and chemical components (e.g., DNA and proteins) (Zhou et al.2020; Kong et al.2009; Dobrynin et al.2009; Kaushik et al.2018). With a growing understanding of these mechanisms, plasma has been utilized in practical applications, including air disinfection, medical equipment sterilization, and the treatment of certain infectious diseases.',\n",
       "  'The precise mechanisms of plasma inactivating pathogenic microorganisms remain unclear and vary across studies (Izadjoo et al.2018). However, two primary mechanisms are commonly proposed: (1) disruption of the microbial cell membrane; and (2) modification of proteins, DNA, and other biopolymers within the microorganisms. The impact of plasma on cell membranes is highly dependent on the structure of the target organisms. For example, significant differences in plasma treatment outcomes are observed between Gram-negative bacteria (e.g.,Escherichia coli) and Gram-positive bacteria (e.g.,Bacillus subtilis). Laroussi et al. reported that plasma treatment caused clear cell lysis in Gram-negative bacteria but did not significantly alter the cell structure of Gram-positive bacteria although it did reduce their viability (Laroussi2002; Laroussi et al.2002). Nishime et al. suggested that this discrepancy may be attributed to differences in cell wall structure. Their experiments showed that plasma treatment led to pronounced lysis and leakage of fungal cells, moderate leakage and structural changes in Gram-negative bacteria, and minimal changes in Gram-positive bacteria (Nishime et al.2017) Notably, while the fungal cells appeared most affected in the electron microscopy images, they were actually the most resistant to plasma treatment, followed by Gram-negative bacteria(Nishime et al.2017). This suggests that plasma can affect bacterial and fungal viability through mechanisms beyond membrane disruption. The strong oxidative and reductive properties of RONS are believed to react with critical biomolecules like DNA and proteins, disrupting cellular processes and inhibiting microorganism activity.',\n",
       "  'Given the complex composition of plasma, which includes electric fields, RONS, and vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) radiation, researchers have investigated which factor plays a dominant role in microbial inactivation. Laroussi et al. (2004) used non-invasive spectroscopic diagnostics to identify O, OH, and NO2as key species in APPJ-induced microbial inactivation, suggesting that thermal effects and UV radiation play secondary roles. The cell membranes of microorganisms, composed of lipid bilayers with unsaturated fatty acids, are susceptible to attack by hydroxyl radicals produced by plasma (Montie et al.2000). Thus, plasma-generated hydroxyl radicals can also impair membrane transport functions. This highlights the critical role of RONS in microbial inactivation, significantly disrupting cellular functions and leading to microorganism death. In contrast, conventional UV radiation does not appear to be the primary mechanism of sterilization. Lunov et al. (2015) demonstrated that UV radiation had no significant effect onStaphylococcus aureus,E. coli, andB. subtiliswhen isolated from other plasma components using sapphire glass. Simon et al. also found that the sterilization efficacy of plasma was primarily attributed to chemical species rather than direct VUV radiation (Schneider et al.2011).',\n",
       "  'In application, microbial inactivation effects of APPJs have been verified in treating infectious skin diseases and wound healing. Although APPJs may not offer economic advantages over traditional clinical treatments for infectious skin diseases, its broad-spectrum antimicrobial effects and resistance to microbial resistance make it an excellent alternative to conventional treatments. For infectious skin diseases, Daeschlein et al. treated clinically isolated pathogens causing skin diseases, includingTrichophyton interdigitale,Trichophyton rubrum,Microsporum canis, andCandida albicans, with APPJs. The results showed that plasma treatment inhibited the growth of these fungi, with the most significant inhibition observed forC. albicansafter 15\\xa0s of treatment, and the least significant inhibition observed forM. canis. None of the isolated fungal strains exhibited resistance to APPJ treatment. Additionally, APPJ treatment completely eradicated fungal components on dandruff from patients with tinea pedis and contaminated shoes (Daeschlein et al.2011). Wu et al. tested the efficacy of APPJ against two strains causing green and black nail diseases,Pseudomonas aeruginosaandCandida albicans. In vitro experiments showed that APPJ effectively killed both strains. Subsequently, using bovine hooves as a human nail model, they verified the effectiveness of APPJ treatment, finding that the concentration of both strains decreased by 2 and 4 orders of magnitude, respectively, after 5\\xa0min of treatment (Wu et al.2019). For clearance of wound microbial infections, Isbary et al. approached the issue from a clinical perspective, using a MW-driven APPJ device from the kINPen company. They treated 38 chronic infected wounds in 36 patients for 5\\xa0min daily based on standard wound care procedures. The results showed that the bacterial load in all 38 wounds was significantly reduced after treatment, with no side effects, proving that Ar–APPJ treatment is a safe and painless method to reduce bacterial load in chronic wound surfaces. Subsequently, Isbary et al. conducted a prospective, randomized controlled phase II study using the MicroPlaSter device on 24 patients with chronic infected wounds. They treated the wounds daily for 2\\xa0min with Ar–APPJ and compared the effects of the two generations of MicroPlaSter devices. A total of 207 treatments from 24 patients were analyzed, finding that the bacterial load in the wounds was significantly reduced after plasma treatment, regardless of the bacterial species, with no side effects and good tolerance to treatment. These results from both in vitro and clinical experiments confirm the role of APPJs in the elimination of wound microbial infections and do not show any obvious side effects, suggesting it may become a new treatment method to overcome bacterial resistance (Isbary et al.2010,2012).',\n",
       "  'In summary, the antimicrobial efficacy of plasma primarily stems from RONS. Therefore, effective inactivation can be achieved through direct treatment using APPJs or indirect treatment via agents like activated water (Li et al.2018). In application field, treatment by APPJs presents a broad spectrum of microbial inactivation capabilities and therefore a wider range of action than current clinical drugs. Effects of microbial inactivation have been demonstrated in in vivo, in vitro, and some clinical trials. However, high cost and the high demands placed on operators make APPJ a poor alternative to current clinical treatment options. Therefore, the microbial inactivation capability of APPJ still needs to be suitable for application scenarios.',\n",
       "  'Plasma treatment at temperatures above room temperature is a common method for wound treatment and hemostasis during surgery (Kong et al.2009). Although numerous tools exist currently for blood coagulation, most of these methods have various degrees of deleterious side effects that must be carefully managed. Plasma shows its advantages as a potential tool for controlling blood coagulation rates at specific locations with minimal side effects as CAP triggers natural blood coagulation processes through selective actions of CAP on blood proteins (Chen et al.2022).',\n",
       "  'The coagulation mechanism is based on heat-induced denaturation of tissue proteins, drying of blood, and thermal sealing of the bleeding area by “sealing” the tissue (Shimizu and Ikehara2017). Fridman et al. (2006) also achieved blood coagulation using plasma near room temperature (FE-DBD), indicating that plasma can trigger the coagulation process under normal temperature conditions. To clarify the mechanism of plasma-assisted hemostasis, Kong et al. (2009) conducted experiments and pointed out that plasma activates the coagulation cascade by inducing the aggregation of coagulation protein fibrinogen into fibrin. Ikehara et al. (2015) found that plasma jets not only activate platelets and coagulation factors in the blood during the treatment of bleeding wounds but also stimulate the aggregation of other species in the blood. Miyamoto et al. demonstrated that plasma jets induce the aggregation of serum proteins, resulting in membranous structures that promote coagulation. They also suggested that the plasma jets may not only cause blood clotting by platelet aggregation and coagulation but also affect red blood cells, and the membranous structures produced by red blood cell hemolysis may be related to the current strength (Miyamoto et al.2016).',\n",
       "  'APPJs have been used to realize the blood coagulation in some studies. Bekeschus et al. tested the suitability of an APPJ (kINPen MED) as a new medical device for sufficient blood coagulation in a murine model of liver incision. To analyze the biological effect of plasma on blood coagulation in vivo, mice were anticoagulated (clopidogrel inhibiting cellular and rivaroxaban inhibiting plasmatic hemostasis) or received vehicle only. Afterwards, a partial resection of the left lateral liver lobe was performed. The quantification of the blood loss after liver incision followed by treatment with APPJ or electrocauterization revealed a similar and significant hemostatic performance in native and rivaroxaban but not clopidogrel-treated animals (Bekeschus et al.2017). Yan et al. presents plasma-induced blood coagulation in rat hepatectomy using a home-made APPJ device. Experimental results show that the cold plasma can lead to rapid blood coagulation. Compared with the control sample, the plasma-induced agglomerated layer of blood is thicker and denser and mostly composed of broken platelets (Yan et al.2018).',\n",

We begin with the review of APPJ research, discussing the impact of electrode structure, excitation sources, gas atmosphere and the surface characteristics. Then we discuss the kinetics in APPJ–surface interaction. As for bulk processes, we summarize the studies of ionization waves, reactive species, gas heating, and flow control. In the part of surface processes, surface ionization waves, sheath, surface reactions, and surface heating are introduced. In this section, we indicate that bulk processes and surface processes can both influence each other. As for the application perspective, the review discusses the practical application of APPJs on material processing and bio-medicine. In material processing scenario, APPJs can modify the material properties by grafting, deposition and etching. In bio-medicine area, APPJs can induce the electroporation or intracellular electromanipulation, penetrating under the skin, selectively kill cancer cells, inactivate microbes, and promote blood coagulation.

Developing more precise and universally applicable models that couple plasma dynamics with surface chemistry is essential.',\n",
       "  'Standardization of APPJs. APPJs can be adjusted in terms of power sources, geometric structure, and treatment methods. This flexibility makes standardization of APPJs a difficult task.

Prior to practical application, standardization is necessary to establish industry consensus and facilitate unified management under regulation.',\n",

Metal Chalcogenides, specifically metal sulfides owing to their tunable band gap, high absorbance and emission properties, high mobility, and excellent charge transfer properties compared to metal oxides, are more suitable for specific optoelectronic applications [2]. Among the various metal sulfides, Antimony sulfide (Sb2S3) has garnered significant attention among researchers due to its cost-effectiveness, non-toxic properties, and natural existence as the mineral stibnite. It possesses an orthorhombic crystal structure withPbnmaspace symmetry and offers a tunable optical bandgap of approximately 1.6-2\\xa0eV, n-type semiconductor characteristics, and high intrinsic mobility [3].

This distinctive structure enables efficient electron transport, as graphene can be readily tuned from n-type (electron-dominated) to charge neutral, and further to p-type (hole-dominated) by adjusting the gate voltage [34,35]. This tunability allows for precise control over the type and concentration of charge carriers, significantly enhancing the material's overall transport properties. Secondly, graphene has excellent gas and liquid barrier properties, a high surface area, and biocompatibility, which not only maintains stability but also supports a higher load of biological receptors, offering great stability and sensing potential [36,37]. Furthermore, graphene’s exceptional chemical tunability allows for the formation of various derivatives, facilitating chemical modifications [38,39]. These custom interface designs not only improve the selectivity of graphene-based biosensors but also significantly expand their applications in biometric detection. Lastly, graphene’s mechanical properties provide attractive prospects for wearable and implantable smart devices [40,41]. Combining the advantages of graphene and FETs, flexible graphene field-effect transistors (FGFETs) are considered revolutionary innovations in flexible sensor technology, demonstrating many advantages in biosensing including ease of operation, fast response [42,43], real-time monitoring [44,45,46,47], high specificity and sensitivity, low detection limits [48,49], broad detection ranges [50,51], and microfluidic integration [52,53,54]. Therefore, FGFETs and their applications in flexible biomedical sensors are garnering increasing attention. Through a\\xa0literature review, we found that most existing reviews on flexible field-effect transistor electronics mainly focus on those based on organic materials [3,55]. Although there are also some reviews on flexible GFET electronics, they are mostly outdated and do not systematically summarize the construction of FGFET electronics and their applications in flexible biomedical sensing [56,57]. Given the advantages of flexible GFETs in the field of flexible electronics and the general interest in flexible sensors, along with recent significant advancements in this area, a specialized review of FGFETs and their applications in flexible biomedical sensing is necessary, which would be greatly beneficial not only to experts in electronics/semiconductor, material chemistry, soft matter science, and sensor technology but also to newcomers in these fields.\",\n",
       "  'This review provides a detailed overview of the latest advancements in FGFETs, including the construction of high-performance FGFETs and their applications in flexible biomedical sensing (Fig.1). It is important to note that the term \"graphene\" here encompasses all forms of graphene and its derivatives. To facilitate a better understanding of FGFETs, this paper begins with an introduction to the basic structure, operating mechanism, and evaluation parameters of these devices. Subsequently, we discuss the constituent materials and device patterning techniques for FGFETs, offering guidance on strategies for constructing high-performance devices. The FGFETs’ versatile strain sensing capabilities and sensitive response to bioelectrical signals make them highly adaptable for various applications. We particularly focus on the applications of FGFETs in wearable and implantable biosensing, highlighting key aspects of building high-performance flexible biosensors. Lastly, we explore the future developments in this field. It is worth noting that this review does not aim to exhaustively cover all literature related to FGFETs and FGFET-based flexible biomedical sensors. Instead, it emphasizes significant protocols, opportunities, trends, and challenges in this area. We hope that this discussion will be beneficial for future research aimed at realizing high-quality GFETs and their applications in flexible biomedical sensing.',\n",

FGFETs are typically three-terminal devices consisting of a flexible substrate, a dielectric layer, a graphene active layer, and source-drain and gate electrodes. These transistors come in several forms depending on the position of the gate: back-gated, top-gated, and double-gated, as depicted in Fig.2a-c. Additionally, based on the type of gate dielectric used, they can be classified into solid-gated and solution-gated structures, illustrated in Fig.2d, e.',\n",

       "  \"As shown in Fig.2f, solid-gate GFETs operate similarly to traditional silicon-based field-effect transistors. In these devices, the voltage applied to the gate modulates the charge density and type (either holes or electrons) in the channel via the gate insulator's capacitance. Different gate voltages create varied electric fields between the gate and the channel, inducing a space charge layer of equal magnitude but opposite polarity on each side of the gate insulation. When sufficient space charge accumulates, it forms a conductive path in the semiconductor layer. At a given source-drain voltage (VSD), charge flows from the source electrode through this conductive channel to the drain electrode, creating a current.\",\n",
       "  'For solution-gated GFETs, which use an electrolyte solution as the dielectric instead of a traditional insulating material, the operation is slightly different. As depicted in Fig.2g, applying a voltage between the gate and the source causes anions and cations in the electrolyte to migrate, forming two electrochemical double layers at the interfaces of the semiconductor/electrolyte and gate/electrolyte. This gate voltage modulates the potential in the channel via these double layers, establishing a channel of charge carriers (electrons or holes). Consequently, under the influence ofVSD, a current flows from the source to the drain.',\n",

It is important to note that the carrier density and type (electrons or holes) in the GFET channel are dictated by the potential difference between the channel and the gate. A high positive gate voltage encourages electron accumulation, forming an n-type channel, whereas a high negative gate voltage results in a p-type channel.',\n",
       "  'In general, the evaluation parameters for conventional FETs include threshold voltage (VTh), mobility (μ), switching ratio (Ion/Ioff), and subthreshold swing (SS). However, due to the unique zero-bandgap structure of GFETs, these devices cannot achieve a true-off state. As a result, our discussion focuses on alternative key performance metrics for FGFETs, specificallyμ, the Dirac point, and mechanical flexibility.',\n",
       "  'μrepresents the drift velocity of charge carriers per unit electric field, which indicates the ability of electrons or holes to move within a semiconductor under varying electric fields. There exists a positive feedback relationship between the speed of carrier movement and its mobility; that is, the faster the carriers move, the higher their mobility, and conversely, the slower they move, the lower their mobility. Transfer curves are a commonly used method to estimate mobility.',\n",

       "  'Due to the unique electrical characteristics of graphene, GFETs are typically only weakly saturated. As a result, mobility calculations for GFETs usually rely on the formula for the linear region. Additionally, GFETs can transport both electrons and holes, thus exhibiting both electron and hole mobilities. High mobility means that GFETs have high-speed switching capabilities, high charge density, and low power consumption, expanding their applications in advanced electronic technologies. The mobility of GFETs is influenced by various factors, such as material quality, substrate effects, environmental conditions, electron scattering, doping, device structure, and dimensions. Understanding how these factors impact graphene mobility is essential for optimizing GFET design and performance.',\n",
       "  \"The Dirac point is an evaluation parameter unique to GFETs. In a graphene FET, the minimum conductivity point on its transport curve is the Dirac point (VDirac), representing the potential where electrons and holes are equally abundant. In intrinsic graphene, the Dirac point corresponds to the energy level of the Fermi energy, close to 0\\xa0V on the transport curve. Typically, the presence of adsorbed molecules or defects induces doping effects, shifting the graphene Fermi surface above or below the Dirac cone point, as depicted in Fig.3c. This shift transforms the dominant carriers into electrons or holes, primarily through charge transfer between the dopant and graphene. If the dopant's lowest unoccupied electron orbital is below graphene’s Fermi energy level, the charge transfers from graphene to the dopant, creating a p-type doping scenario. Here, the p-type branch of the GFET transport curve requires a higher gate voltage to turn on, movingVDiracto a more positive potential, as shown on the right side of Fig.3d. Conversely, if the highest occupied orbital of the dopant is above the Fermi energy level, the charge transfers from the dopant to graphene, establishing n-type doping, which reduces the gate voltage to turn on the n-type branch of the GFET transport curve and shiftsVDiracto a negative potential, as shown on the left side of Fig.3d. The Dirac point in graphene is a crucial parameter for GFET-based sensors, with many such sensors detecting target molecules through doping effects [72,73,74].\",\n",

       "  'Mechanical flexibility is a crucial factor in assessing whether FGFET can maintain good performance parameters when subjected to bending, stretching, and twisting. Bending is the most common mechanical deformation, thus we focus here on the mechanical flexibility of flexible GFETs under bending deformation.',\n",
       "  'As illustrated in Fig.3e, when FGFET is subjected to bending stress, a strain-neutral mechanical plane emerges within it that is neither tensile nor compressive [75,76]. Thus, the material surface at this layer remains unaffected by strain. The surface above the neutral layer experiences tensile strain, while the surface below experiences compressive strain. Excessive tensile strain on the upper surface of the sensor beyond its tolerance limit may lead to material failure, while excessive compressive stress on the lower surface may cause detachment of certain structures on the device. Therefore, the design and fabrication of the sensor should ensure that the working layer is positioned as close as possible to the strain-neutral layer, minimizing strain on the working surface of the sensor during mechanical deformation.',\n",
       "  \"For systems with complex multilayer composite structures like sensors, the distance between the strain-neutral layer and the substrate's lower surface (Hneutral) is given by the following Eq.\\xa0(3):\",\n",

       "  \"whereds,dw,Hneutral,andRrepresent the thickness of the substrate, the thickness of the working layer, the distance between the strain-neutral layer and the lower surface of the substrate, and the radius of curvature of the bend, respectively. The maximum ultimate strain represents the highest level of strain a device can endure without significant performance degradation or structural damage. A combined analysis of Eqs. (3) and (4) reveals that the position of the strain-neutral layer in an FGFET is determined solely by the material's physical properties and thickness, and is independent of the degree of bending deformation the flexible sensor experiences. In other words, variations in the bending radius do not affect the neutral layer's location, indicating that the maximum ultimate strain sustainable by the FGFET surface is pre-determined by material selection and structural design. Typically, in flexible GFETs, the working layer is much thinner than the substrate material, rendering its impact on the strain-neutral layer's position negligible. However, a thicker substrate shifts the neutral layer closer to itself, increasing the distance between the working layer and the neutral layer. This results in an increase in strain and a decrease in the maximum ultimate strain. Additionally, in FGFETs, the neutral layer tends to shift towards materials with a higher effective Young's modulus (\\\\(\\\\frac{{E}_{i}}{1-{\\\\nu }_{i}^{2}}\\\\)). Therefore, to position the working layer as close as possible to the neutral layer, the working layer's effective Young's modulus should be slightly higher than that of the base material. This implies selecting a working layer material with a higher Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio. However, these parameters should not be excessively high; they should be dynamically balanced with the substrate material to ensure the working layer aligns as closely as possible with the strain-neutral layer.\",\n",
       "  \"Thus, minimizing the thickness of each component is crucial in the design and fabrication of flexible GFETs. Furthermore, the Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio of the working layer stack should be slightly higher than those of the substrate material. These strategies maximize the ultimate strain that the FGFET can withstand while reducing the strain on the working surface during mechanical deformation.\",\n",
       "  'Unlike conventional silicon-based GFETs, which primarily focus on electrical properties, FGFETs require a comprehensive trade-off between electronic properties and mechanical flexibility. The flexibility, ductility, and fatigue resistance of these devices place new demands on the materials used, necessitating that all components exhibit a requisite level of mechanical flexibility and strength. In addition, high-resolution patterning techniques directly affect device performance, such as output current and mobility, and are a key fabrication technique for preparing high-performance FGFETs. Therefore, this section will explore common patterning processes (photolithography, soft lithography, inkjet and aerosol jet printing, and laser direct writing) for high-performance components (including graphene semiconductors, substrates, gate dielectrics, and electrodes). These high-performance components and precise patterning techniques are foundational for constructing low-cost, compact, high-performance FGFETs on flexible substrates. The integration of these advanced fabrication methods ensures the development of FGFETs that meet the rigorous demands of modern flexible electronics, combining outstanding electronic functionality with essential mechanical properties.',\n",

       "  'To obtain high-quality pristine monolayer or multilayer graphene sheets, the most common method is micromechanical exfoliation of graphite with adhesive tape. This exfoliation method suffers from high preparation cost, low yield, difficulty in precise control, poor reproducibility, and difficulty in large-scale preparation, making it difficult to be integrated into FGFETs on a large scale. Although the epitaxial growth method can achieve high-quality growth of graphene with large area and high uniformity, its growth conditions are harsh and difficult to separate from the silicon substrate, and it is also not suitable for the preparation of flexible graphene FETs [77,78,79].',\n",
       "  'Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD) method is the preferred method for large area synthesis of high-quality graphene. Hydrocarbons are cleaved into carbon and hydrogen atoms at high temperatures, the carbon atoms are deposited on the surface of metals such as copper or nickel sheets to form graphene films in this method [80,81,82]. The metal in this process is both a catalyst and a substrate for the growth of graphene. Graphene can be prepared on a large scale by this method. And the obtained graphene possesses high mobility and quality, while the number of layers can be controlled [78,83]. Therefore, they are widely integrated as graphene channels in FGFETs [84]. Ning et al. [58] proposed a CVD cyclic oxidation/hydrogen annealing process that facilitates the reconstruction of copper foil surfaces, which in turn enables the growth of large single-crystal graphene (LSG) (Fig.4a). Flexible FETs were formed on polyethylene terephthalate substrates using LSG, which exhibited excellent electrical properties and high bendability. The roll-to-roll (R2R) process is considered to be one of the most promising methods for fabricating electronic devices for large-area applications due to the relatively low production cost. Roll-to-roll (R2R) CVD fabrication has been proposed for continuous, large-area graphene film production. Sukang et al. [85] combined a roll-to-roll production method with the wet transfer process to achieve efficient etching and transfer of large-size (30-inch) graphene. (Fig.4b) These films have sheet resistance as low as 125 Ω μm−1, have 97.4% optical transmittance, and exhibit high quality.

       "  'Graphene oxide (GO) is a derivative of graphene. It is prepared by oxidizing graphite using strong acids and oxidizing agents, followed by exfoliating the graphite layer by ultrasonic treatment, and finally purifying the exfoliated GO by ultracentrifugation (Fig.4c) [86]. GO has advantages in terms of quantity, yield, and cost compared to CVD graphene. In addition, it possesses solution processing capabilities compatible with various flexible electronics preparation processes, such as spin-coating, spraying, printing, and adhesive coating methods [87,88,89,90], which allows its use as a channel layer for flexible FETs and is of great interest in the field of flexible electronics. However, the resulting GO is usually electrically insulating. To solve this problem, chemical or thermal reduction methods are commonly used to remove oxygen-containing groups from the surface of graphene oxide to obtain reduced graphene oxide (rGO) (Fig.4d)[86,91,92,93]. rGO not only retains the above-mentioned advantages of GO, but also substantially improves its conductivity. As a channel material for field-effect transistors, it shows electronic properties similar to those of graphene, such as those of bipolar transistors, such as bipolar transistor properties, making it seem to be a promising alternative material to graphene [91,93,94]. For example, He et al. [91] fabricated fully rGO thin-film transistors using a combination of solution-treated rGO electrodes and micropatterned rGO channels. This electronic device has perfect flexibility, high transparency, and typical bipolar properties, and shows good sensitivity in detecting proteins in physiological buffers.',\n",
       "  'Graphene oxide paper is a novel paper material made of single graphene oxide flakes that maintains excellent electrical properties and chemical stability in the format of GO nanosheets [95,96]. Nevertheless, the large aggregation of 2D graphene flakes severely limits the field-effect sensing response [97], allowing the conductivity change of the GO paper to occur only within its nanometer-thick epidermal layer [98]. Therefore, the conductivity change of macroscopic materials up to hundreds of micrometers in thickness is negligible or even undetectable. In order to overcome the aggregation effect, Huang et al. [99] constructed 3D hybrid materials with alternating GO and hexylamine molecular layers (GO/hexylamine paper). This material has a layer-by-layer ordered superlattice structure that maintains stable electrical and field effect properties under mechanical stress (Fig.4d).

       "  'Due to the proliferation of various printing technologies, graphene ink, which is compatible with them, has been widely noticed and used as a semiconductor layer material for FGFETs in recent years [100,101]. Unlike the chemical exfoliation method of graphene oxide, graphene ink is obtained by liquid phase exfoliation (LPE). This method treats graphite in solvent in ultrasonic waves and uses local hydrodynamic shear to achieve graphene exfoliation [102]. It has the advantages of inexpensive raw materials, high scalability potential, low thermal budget, and compatibility with additive manufacturing technologies, making it an ideal and cost-effective method for manufacturing graphene inks [103,104]. Torrisi et al. [105] used N-methylpyrrolidone as a solvent to exfoliate graphite via LPE technology to produce graphene-based inks (Fig.4e).

The graphene-based ink opens the door to all-printed, flexible, and transparent graphene devices on a variety of substrates. Zhang et al. [100] also used a modified liquid exfoliation method to synthesize graphene ink (Fig.4e) and combined it with an extruded direct ink writing (DIW) technique to prepare liquid gate graphene field effect transistors on PI substrates. Compared to the conventional ethanol-based liquid phase peeling method [103], the addition of pine alcohol to this modified method makes the graphene ink more compatible with printing methods by making it viscous through the exchange of ethanol solvent with pine alcohol.',\n",

The device not only has a high current capacity of 26.72 times that of a 2D transistor, but is fabricated at room temperature and ambient pressure, making it suitable for realization on many flexible polymer substrates. As such, it is applicable to large-area electronics for displays, structural health monitoring and power systems.',\n",

Traditional fabrication methods, such as mechanical exfoliation, although capable of providing high-quality graphene, exhibit significant limitations in terms of cost, yield, controllability, and scalability. Similarly, epitaxial growth methods have shown great potential in improving material quality, yet they still face challenges in terms of integration and flexibility. In contrast, CVD has emerged as the preferred technology for large-scale production of high-quality graphene due to its outstanding scalability, precise controllability, and seamless compatibility with modern device manufacturing processes. Particularly, R2R CVD technology has opened up new avenues for producing continuous, large-area graphene films, greatly enhancing the production scalability and processability of field-effect transistors, as well as flexible and stretchable electronic devices. Additionally, solution-phase graphene derivatives, such as GO, reduced graphene oxide, and graphene inks, demonstrate unique advantages in terms of yield, mass production, and solution processing, bringing additional versatility to the manufacturing of flexible electronic devices. Therefore, graphene prepared via CVD and its solution-phase derivatives emerge as the ideal choice for fabricating high-performance flexible GFETs, offering robust technical support and broad application prospects for future electronic devices.',\n",

Additionally, the thermal stability and surface smoothness of the substrate material are crucial for maintaining good contact between the substrate and other components, as well as compatibility with conventional device fabrication processes. As shown in Fig.5, currently reported FGFET substrates include thin glass [107,108], metal foil [109], rubber [61], polymers [110,111], biodegradable biomaterials [112,113,114], etc.',\n",

However, the low upper working temperature and high surface roughness are their biggest drawbacks, which make them difficult to be compatible with fine manufacturing processes and fabricate microscale devices.

In addition, its easy availability, chemical stability, low Young’s modulus (≈3.7\\xa0MPa), skin-friendliness, and good adhesion to electronic materials make it a good choice for E-skin applications [61,121]. However, PDMS is permeable to aqueous solutions [122], which causes it to swell in liquid environments and damage metal parts of the device [123], thus limiting its application in biosensors. The properties of polyimide (PI), with a higher glass transition temperature (360–410 °C) [124] and a lower CTE (16\\xa0ppm °C−1) and low Young's modulus (≈2.8 GPa) [125], are better than PDMS. In addition, it has long-term stability and good biocompatibility [126], so flexible PI-based devices can be used for implantation [101,111,127].

Although the above polymer substrates are well suited to meet the repeated bending and stretching requirements of flexible GFETs, they take a long time to biodegrade, which can lead to serious environmental pollution problems. Therefore, cellulose paper [112,130], microbial cellulose [131] and silk substrates [110,114] have also been investigated as substrates of FGFETs because they are biodegradable, flexible, lightweight, cost-effective, breathable, comfy, and durable [132].\",\n",

Choosing the right substrate can optimize the overall performance of FGFETs to meet the demands of specific application areas. For wearable electronic devices, key attributes include high flexibility, good biocompatibility, chemical resistance, and skin-friendliness. Consequently, PDMS is widely used in electronic skin and similar devices due to its excellent flexibility and low cost. PI is particularly suitable for long-term skin contact applications due to its high thermal stability and exceptional biocompatibility. For high-performance flexible electronics that require heat resistance and mechanical stability, PES and PI exhibit superior thermal stability, making them ideal choices. Environmental sensors need materials that offer chemical stability, environmental tolerance, and cost-effectiveness. In this context, PEI and PI are preferred due to their robust chemical and thermal stability, which maintains performance under various environmental conditions. In the field of biomedical sensors, biocompatibility, chemical stability, and gentle mechanical properties are essential. PI is suitable for implantable devices, while microbial cellulose, with its biodegradability and mild mechanical properties, fits temporary biomedical applications well. For eco-friendly electronic products, biodegradability, low environmental impact, and cost-effectiveness are central considerations. Cellulose paper and silk substrates, due to their low cost and good biodegradability, are suitable for eco-friendly disposable electronic products.',\n",

       "  'In contrast, organic polymer dielectrics have several built-in benefits, such as low-temperature solution processing, low film density, high leakage current density, strong compatibility with flexible substrates, customizable molecular structure [139,140,141], making it possible to include polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) [142], polyxylene [119], polyimide (NPI) [143], poly-4-vinyl phenol and poly (melamine-co-formaldehyde) (PVP/PMF) [144], poly(1,3,5-trimethyl-1,3,5-trivinylcyclotrisiloxane) (pV3D3) [145] within the polymeric insulating materials are widely used for flexible GFETs. However, these polymer dielectrics generally have low dielectric constants (κ\\u2009<\\u20093.0) compared to inorganic rigid dielectrics. As a result, their use as dielectric layers leads to a weaker dielectric shielding effect. This reduced shielding makes the carriers in graphene more prone to scattering by impurities, defects, or phonons, thereby decreasing the mobility of the GFET [146,147,148,149,150]. Additionally, dielectric layers with low dielectric constants require a higher electric field strength per unit voltage to achieve the desired electric field. Consequently, the gate voltage must be increased to reach the necessary field strength, which in turn raises the operating voltage of the GFET. This increased operating voltage does not align with the low energy requirements of wearable electronics. To solve these problems, Dang et al. [151] combined organic polymers with metal oxide dielectrics to prepare the flexible hybrid organic–inorganic (Al2O3/PVP/Al2O3) dielectric layer (Fig.6b), which improves the electrical properties of the device to some extent while retaining good flexibility. In addition, Wen et al. [149] applied the high-κ polymer P(VDF-TrFE-CFE) in the dielectric layer of graphene FETs (Fig.6c). The overall performance of the GFETs with P(VDF-TrFE-CFE) dielectric is considerably improved compared to common dielectrics (SiO2and PMMA), with hole mobility of 3.46\\u2009×\\u2009103cm2V–1s–1, electron mobility of 2.26\\u2009×\\u2009103cm2V–1s–1, and on/off ratio of 4.28. Furthermore, the devices have good adaptability to flexible substrates. This research fills the gap in the research topic of GFETs with organic high-κ dielectrics.',\n",
       "  'Ionic gel is a kind of gel electrolyte based on ionic liquid. Generally, it is formed by adding an ionic liquid as additives to the polymer framework, in which 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide ([EMIM][TFSI]) and various polymers such as enolate (PEGDA) monomer, pentaerythritol tetraacrylate (PETEA),\\xa0and poly(styrene block methyl methacrylate-block styrene) (PS-PMMA-PS) are often used as ionic liquid and the polymeric framework, respectively [106,152,153]. In addition to excellent mechanical flexibility and optical transparency, they have very high capacitance values [60,61,154,155], and can be processed in solution at room temperature, which makes them ideal for use in flexible plastic substrates. Therefore, it is\\xa0an ideal dielectric material for flexible field effect devices [60,106,156], Jin et al. [60] used ionic gels as gate dielectrics to fabricate low-voltage working graphene FET arrays on plastic substrates (Fig.6d). Due to the extremely high capacitance of the ionic gel (5.17\\xa0μF\\xa0cm−2), high on-state current and low voltage operation are provided for the graphene FET. And it also shows very good mechanical flexibility, with only a 20% change inμ/μ0as the bend radius changes from 6 to 0.6\\xa0cm.',\n",
       "  'In addition to the dielectric materials mentioned above, there is a special gate dielectric layer, the electrolyte solution. It is often used to prepare FGFET because it not only greatly increases the gate capacitance and provides lower operating voltage and higher electrical performance for the device, but also its fluidic nature makes it good for flexibility [157]. We usually refer to transistors with solution dielectrics as solution-gated field-effect transistors, and their structural simplicity and stability in aqueous solutions make them good candidates for detecting solution-phase molecules. In solution-gated GFETs, the ionic concentration of the electrolyte solution is a critical factor. Increasing the ion concentration leads to near-complete neutralization of impurity charges by the ions, which brings the effective net impurity charge close to zero. This neutralization significantly reduces scattering caused by charged impurities, thereby enhancing the carrier mobility in GFETs [158]. Consequently, adjusting the content and concentration of the electrolyte can effectively modulate the performance of solution-gated GFETs [146,158]. The most commonly used electrolyte solution is PBS, and Majd et al. [159] fabricated a solution-gated FET with a phosphate buffer solution at pH\\xa0=\\xa07.5 (Fig.6e). This solution-gated graphene field effect transistor provided a lower operating potential compared to the reverse gated device. Notably, in solution-gated field-effect transistor-based biosensing, biomolecules are subjected to ion screening due to the presence of mobile ions in the solution, called the Debye screening effect. Higher ion concentrations will result in a stronger Debye screening effect, i.e., a shorter Debye length. Beyond this length, the charge is effectively shielded, with only 36.8% of the charge still visible to the graphene sensing device, which can significantly degrade the sensing performance of the biosensor. The issues related to the Debye length are described in detail in the review \"Sensing at the Surface of Graphene Field-Effect Transistors” [160]. Therefore, considering the Debye screening effect and its impact on biosensor performance, proper selection and adjustment of the concentration of the electrolyte solution is crucial in optimizing the performance of solution-gated FGFETs.',\n",
       "  'In summary, the dielectric layer plays a pivotal role in defining the performance and reliability of FGFETs, with each type of dielectric layer having its unique characteristics and suitability for different applications. Metal oxide dielectrics are widely used due to their high dielectric constant and stability, but their brittleness and rigidity limit their use in flexible devices. Conversely, organic polymer dielectrics offer flexibility and processability, but their lower dielectric constant increases the operating voltage and reduces carrier mobility. Hybrid organic–inorganic dielectric layers combine the advantages of both materials, enhancing electrical performance while maintaining flexibility. Additionally, ionic gels provide mechanical flexibility, optical transparency, and high capacitance, making it easy to integrate into flexible plastic substrates and enabling FGFETs to operate at low voltages with high on-state currents. Solution-gated FGFETs using electrolyte solutions offer adjustable device performance and show great promise in biosensing applications, though the electrolyte concentration must be carefully considered to mitigate Debye screening effects and optimize sensing performance. Advances in dielectric materials and structures have significantly propelled the development of high-performance, flexible graphene-based electronic devices across various applications.',\n",
       "  'Flexible electrodes, another important research consideration in FGFET design, have also attracted significant research interest. The ability to smoothly inject carriers from the electrode into the semiconductor layer is a fundamental requirement for flexible FET electrodes, involving both good, tight physical contact between the electrode material and the graphene semiconductor, and a good energy level match between the two. Low and consistent contact resistance will be possible as a result, which will enhance charge injection between the semiconductor and the electrode. In addition, the flexibility of the electrodes is also an issue to be considered in order to achieve high performance FGFETs.',\n",
       "  \"Indium tin oxide (ITO) films, known for their electrical conductivity and optical transparency, have been widely used in optoelectronics for decades [161]. However, ITO films are hard and brittle, and can easily break when subjected to small tensile strains, which limits their application in FGFETs [106,161,162]. Currently, the most prevalent electrode material in flexible graphene transistors is gold (Fig.7a). In order to reduce the contact resistance between the gold electrode and graphene, a layer of Ti, Cr, Ni, and other metals with Fermi energy levels closer to the function of graphene is normally deposited first. This operation not only reduces the contact resistance between the two but also improves the adhesion of the gold electrode so that it is not easy to fall off. Although conventional metallic materials serve as electrodes with good electrical conductivity, they suffer from a very high Young's hardness, which increases the hardness of the built devices. Although small mechanical bending and stretching can be withstood by reducing the thickness of the metal film, due to the Ostwald ripening effect, the reduction in metal film thickness usually causes the creation of isolated metal islands, thus sacrificing conductivity [163,164]. Therefore, when using metals as electrodes, the thickness of the appropriate film should be selected to balance the electrical and mechanical properties of the FGFET. Liquid metal, an indefinite and flowable special metallic material, has been studied as a candidate for flexible device electrodes because of its high electrical conductivity, high flexibility (Young's modulus is almost zero) and non-toxicity [165,166,167,168,169]. Generally, it\\xa0is prepared by a low-temperature melting process, where different metallic materials (mainly gallium and indium alloys as base materials) are formed in a certain ratio and fully melted by temperature control [170]. In combination with sprayed stencil technology, Melcher et al. [171] have successfully integrated it as an electrode in a flexible top-gated GFET (Fig.7b) with the hole and electron mobilities of 663.5–689.9\\xa0cm2V–1s–1, respectively.\",\n",

Consequently, nano-conductive materials such as conductive polymers (TC), metal nanomaterials (metal nanoparticles (NPs) and metal nanowires (NWs)), carbon-based materials (graphene and carbon nanotubes (CNTs)) can be dissolved in inexpensive solvents by relatively simple methods to prepare flexible electrodes by printing, spin coating, and spraying. It has drawn a lot of attention in the field of the preparation of flexible electronic devices as their low temperature and non-vacuum operation, low raw material cost can compensate for some defects in macroscopic materials.',\n",
       "  'Conductive polymers (CP), including polypyrrole, polythiophene, polyaniline and poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT: PSS), are commonly used as flexible electrode materials [133,172,173]. The electrical and mechanical properties of these conducting polymers can be fine-tuned depending on their microstructure, synthesis method and doping process [174,175,176]. Among them, PEDOT: PSS is the most widely used CP in flexible electronics due to its good electrical stability, mechanical strength, optical transmittance, film homogeneity and biocompatibility [177,178,179]. Li et al. [61] constructed an all-graphene FET on a rubber substrate using PEDOT: PSS (conductivity of 100 S cm−1) as the gate (Fig.7c). All-graphene FETs exhibited good electrical properties with hole and electron mobility rates of 1188\\u2009±\\u2009136 and 422\\u2009±\\u200952\\xa0cm2V−1s−1, and mechanically stable, even after 1000 or more cycles, at stretching degrees up to 5%.',\n",
       "  'Metal nanoparticles (mNPs) and metal nanowires (mNWs) can achieve higher electrical conductivity compared to conductive polymers. In addition, it also exhibits improved mechanical flexibility and stretchability [180,181]. Precious metal particles, such as gold nanoparticles (AuNPs), platinum nanoparticles (PtNPs) and silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) have attracted great interest due to their high electrical conductivity and excellent electrochemical activity [101,182,183]. However, the high cost of these precious metals hinders their practical applications. Copper nanoparticles (CuNPs) are considered promising candidates to replace most noble metals because of their relatively low cost, non-toxic elements and high electrical conductivity [22]. Zeng et al. [115] designed multilayer graphene-encapsulated copper nanoparticles (MLG-CuNPs) with excellent electrical and mechanical properties (Fig.7d). The resistivity of MLG-CuNPs/PI increased to 1.7\\u2009×\\u200910–6, which is 100 times lower than that previously reported [184], and its resistivity increased by only ∼7% after 1000 bending cycles. The MLG-CuNPs were used as source/drain electrodes to fabricate the GFET on the flexible PI substrate, showing hole and electron mobilities of ∼940–∼800\\xa0cm2V–1s–1, respectively.',\n",
       "  'Metal nanowires (mNW) not only have the advantages of low thin layer resistance, visual transparency, ease of use and low cost [185,186], and due to their relatively large aspect ratio, have good mechanical compliance [187,188,189,190]. Therefore, it shows crucial promise in flexible transparent electrodes/conductors as well as in flexible stretchable electrodes. The most commonly used mNW is AgNW [185,188]. However, the single mNW also has some drawbacks, such as the limitation of mNW percolation network in reducing its pattern size and weakness of mNW to electric breakdown, chemical oxidation, and high thin layer resistance [185,191,192,193]. Graphene–mNW hybrid nanostructures can make up for the shortcomings of mNWs single material. Moreover, with their low resistance (<\\u200935 Ω\\xa0sq−1) and high light transmission (>\\u200990% in the visible range) as well as their excellent mechanical flexibility and stretchability, they have attracted considerable attention [194,195,196]. Jin et al. [197] used a graphene-AgNW hybrid film as source/drain electrodes to prepare a GFET. Graphene penetrated all the conducting elements of the device, including the channel and the electrode, the contact resistance between the channel and the source/drain was reduced, which improved the mobility of the field-effect transistor\\xa0(≈3000 cm2V−1s−1). The high elastic modulus of graphene and AgNW and the hydrophobicity of parylene enable their transfer to various substrates. This is an exciting approach for the fabrication of transparent wearable electronic devices.',\n",
       "  'Carbon-based nanomaterials, including carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and graphene, are attractive electrode materials for FGFET due to their high electrical conductivity, mechanical strength, and excellent optical transparency [198]. Among them, multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) are relatively suitable as gate electrodes due to their unique characteristics, including high surface area, corrosion resistance, electrochemical stability, high electrical conductivity, and relatively lower manufacturing costs. For example, Liu et al. fabricated a fully carbon-based FET on a flexible polyethylene terephthalate substrate using spray-jet printing. Conductive reduced graphene was used as electrodes (source and drain) and channel, while oxidized graphene served as the dielectric, and multi-walled carbon nanotubes were used as gate electrodes. The FET exhibited a favorable mobility of 350 cm2V–1s–1. Reduced graphene oxide, due to its varying degrees of reduction, exhibits different properties, thus can be used as both a semiconductor layer and an electrode. For instance, Zhang et al. [199] proposed a fully covalent-based FET, which was prepared by covalently layer-by-layer assembling oxidized graphene with (3-aminopropyl) trimethoxysilane (APTMS) coupling agent and subsequently reduced at different temperatures (Fig.7e). Films of rGO with relatively high and low reduction degrees/conductivities (abbreviated as HRE-RGO and LRE-RGO) were used as source/drain electrodes and semiconductor layers of the device, respectively. Unlike FETs prepared by traditional physical deposition methods, the covalent structure of the FET endows it with excellent stability. Even after continuous ultrasound treatment in 10 common solvents for 100\\xa0min (total 1000\\xa0min), the electrical characteristics of the device fluctuated insignificantly. Therefore, it is less prone to degradation or fluctuation during subsequent multi-step fabrication and biological testing processes, and is expected to shine in the application of FGFET.',\n",
       "  'In the design of FGFETs, choosing the right electrode material is crucial for device performance. Metal electrodes like gold, silver, and copper are highly conductive, making them ideal for high-performance electronic devices and precision sensors; however, their poor flexibility can lead to fractures under bending. In contrast, liquid metal electrodes, particularly those based on gallium alloys, offer exceptional flexibility and ductility, making them highly suitable for ultra-flexible and stretchable electronics. Despite this, they may require special encapsulation techniques to prevent metal leakage or corrosion. Additionally, nanomaterial electrodes (conductive polymers, metallic nanomaterials, carbon-based nanomaterials) provide good conductivity and transparency, making them well-suited for transparent electronics and flexible displays, and they also possess good biocompatibility for biomedical devices. Nevertheless, these materials face challenges related to uniformity and repeatability during manufacturing. Therefore, the selection of electrode materials must balance electrical performance, mechanical properties, and cost-effectiveness to ensure suitability for specific applications and environments.',\n",
       "  'Patterning technologies are an important part of the fabrication of graphene-based nanodevices and directly affect the performance of the devices. Patterning during the preparation of FGFETs, which includes patterning of multiple components of graphene semiconductor layers, electrodes, and gate dielectrics, follows the basic idea of removing material from top to bottom or adding material from bottom to top during the fabrication process. The characteristics of flexible electronics should also be considered when drawing on patterning techniques for microelectronic and micro-electro mechanical system (MEMS) devices. Flexible electronics require large-area, low-temperature, low-cost patterning techniques. Commonly used patterning techniques for FGFETs include photolithography, soft lithography, inkjet and aerosol jet printing, laser direct writing.',\n",
       "  'Photolithographic process is a method of transferring patterns from photomasks to substrates through a physicochemical process using photoresists with varying light sensitivity under illumination. It is usually patterned on the insulator using photoresist after spin coating of the desired pattern or structure, and further realized by a peeling process (Fig.8) [200,201]. Due to its high alignment and nesting accuracy, relatively simple photomask production, and easy-to-understand process conditions, photolithography has become a cornerstone of the development of the microelectronics industry. Generally, all components of a GFET device can be patterned by photolithography. For example, Tsai et al. [62] utilized micromachining of the semiconductor layers and source-drain electrodes of GFETs using photolithography. The flexible transparent Gr-FET showed good carrier mobility with 350 cm2V–1s–1, which changed by less than 10% when the bending radius of the flexible device was reduced from 6.0 to 1.0\\xa0cm. Zhuang et al. [110] patterned chromium/gold metal electrodes in the conductive channel and gate of the FGFET using standard double-layer lift-off lithography. In addition, Qing et al. [131] developed GFETs on microbial cellulose (MBC) using photolithography to micromachine the semiconductor layers, and dielectric layers of the device. Utilizing the biocompatibility of graphene and the unique biocompatibility of MBCs, their development of implantable sensors and radiofrequency electronics was a major step forward.',\n",

This method eliminates the photoresist on the graphene channels and forms a clean graphene interface, allowing the constructed GFETs to have high carrier mobility (3590\\u2009±\\u2009710\\xa0cm2V–1s–1) and low accidental doping (Dirac voltage of 9.4\\u2009±\\u20092.7\\xa0V).',\n",

In general, soft lithography is suitable for solution technology and thus is mainly used for patterning graphene solution materials. Compared to conventional lithography, soft lithography offers numerous advantages such as affordability, simplification of experiments, and adaptability to various sample geometries, making it an ideal method for fabricating micrometers and nanostructures [204,209,210].',\n",
       "  'The micro-transfer molding (μTM) method represents a valuable approach for precisely patterning parallel and isolated microstructures. At present, μTM is widely acknowledged as a straightforward, efficient, and adaptable technique specifically suited for creating graphene patterns (Fig.9a). In general, this method involves first spin-coating graphene-based materials onto a substrate, then bringing a PDMS mold modified with hydrophilic dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) into contact with the graphene-based material, transferring the graphene-based material from the initial substrate to the PDMS stamp. Subsequently, the PDMS stamp with the attached graphene-based material is brought into contact with the target substrate. Due to the energy recovery of the PDMS surface, the graphene-based material separates from the PDMS surface, forming a graphene pattern (Fig.9a). Jung et al. [211] provide a typical example of using this graphene patterning method to manufacture FGFETs. They utilized surface energy modification of hydrophilic coating molecules to transfer GO-palladium nanoparticles (rGO-PdNP) composite material onto silk substrates. This rGO-PdNP material was used as a semiconductor layer to construct FGFETs, and exhibited good mobility (311.37\\xa0cm2V–1s–1).

It forms an empty channel grid (PDMS mold) through the contact between the mold and the substrate. The solution then flows into the channels and fills them by capillary forces [213,214]. The pressure difference between the two hydrodynamic connection regions of the fluid leads to the flow of the material solution in the capillaries. After infusion and material deposition, the PDMS mold can be removed from the substrate (Fig.9b) [63,212]. Using this technique, He et al.

Figure9c shows the patterning of graphene using the EISA method, which is compatible with the roll-to-roll system and allows the pattern to be extended to an arbitrarily large region [215]. By the EISA method, PMMA forms an ordered array on the graphene surface, and the part of graphene not protected by PMMA stripes is removed from the top of the graphene pattern by O2plasma etching to form a graphene pattern with transverse stripes.

In inkjet printing technology, several critical parameters, including droplet jet characteristics, solvent evaporation behavior, ink viscosity, and nozzle diameter, significantly influence the resolution. To enhance the quality of inkjet printed films, researchers have made many efforts in ink engineering [217,218,219], substrate treatment [220,221,222] and equipment development [223]. These improvements can effectively improve the controllability of the shape, thickness and morphology of the dried droplets, and enhance the resolution of printed films. Inkjet printing has many advantages including precise control of deposition volume and location, ease of patterning, efficient material usage and minimal contamination from non-contact deposition processes, and good biocompatibility, all of which are required for advanced flexible and wearable electronics manufacturing [103]. Laliberte et al. [182] used a conductive ink printer to print source, drain, and gate electrodes on flexible polymer films and then transferred graphene films to form a flexible GFET (Fig.10a). This GFET modified the aptamer to achieve detection of interleukin-6 (IL-6) protein and exhibited good flexibility.

This printing method uses ultrasonic vibration or airflow to form an aerosol of nano-conductive ink, which is then transferred using a transfer carrier gas (atomization) to the inkjet port where the conductive ink is printed onto the desired substrate [225]. In aerosol jet printing, the jet consists of numerous droplets, each having a diameter of 2–5\\xa0µm, as opposed to inkjet printing, where a single droplet is used. Aerosol printing offers a freer range of height adjustment than inkjet printing that relies on the gravity of the ink droplets to be ejected downward. It depends on the directionality of the masking gas to ensure precise printing, and it is compatible with non-flat substrates [226,227]. Typically, aerosol jet printing is used to pattern electrodes and semiconductor layers, and the FGFET proposed by Yu et al. is a typical example [228]. The devices were printed a source and drain with a channel width of 200\\xa0μm and rGO ink (PBA/rGO) semiconductor layer on a flexible PET substrate by AJP. The Ag/AgCl reference electrode was employed as the gate electrode to provide the desired gate voltage (Vg), thus constructing a flexible solution-gate GFET.

       "  'Ultrafast laser-based graphene processing has yielded impressive results, opening up a wide range of subtractive and additive processes for patterning and functionalizing atomic layer materials. Among them, femtosecond laser processing has attracted attention for its valuable attributes, including scalability, heat-affected zone reduction, and mask-free, programmable patterning capabilities [230,232,233]. Femtosecond laser pulses are capable of locally patterning and tuning the electrical properties of graphene oxide (and ultimately transforming it into reduced graphene oxide) in a controlled manner, and are therefore widely used for GO electrodes and patterning of semiconductor layers (Fig.11a) [234]. For example, He et al. [235] employed an innovative femtosecond laser direct writing (FsLDW) technique to effortlessly produce fully reduced graphene oxide field-effect transistors on flexible substrates by precisely controlling the intensity of the femtosecond laser pulses. At high power and medium power lasers, the FsLDW enables metal and semiconductor RGO micropatterning, respectively, so that source/drain and gate electrodes, as well as semiconductor channels of field effect transistors, can be written directly onto the flexible substrate under ambient conditions. The device shows anIon/Ioffof 2.04 and an estimated hole mobility of 0.27\\xa0cm2V−1s−1. FsLDW advances the application of graphene in transparent, flexible, and stretchable electronic devices, while also facilitating the development of FGFETs. Significantly, the fabrication of metal-free all-RGO FETs through FsLDW eliminates the need for masks or chemical reagents. This method simplifies the preparation process and allows for the flexible integration of graphene-based microdevices, showcasing its significant potential for advancing future electronic devices. FsLDW for all-RGO devices offers distinct advantages, making it a promising avenue for realizing the next generation of electronic devices.',\n",

       "  'Laser-induced graphene (LIG) is a special type of LDW, a technique that forms stacked graphene structures in a photothermal reaction by irradiating PI and PEI films with a pulsed CO2infrared laser [236]. LIG provides favorable electrical properties and the ability to simultaneously fabricate patterns, which makes laser-induced technology an effective method for fabricating graphene-based devices. In addition, the low cost, high fabrication density and the ability to integrate laser-induced graphene directly into flexible common polymers have led to the widespread interest in this method in the field of flexible electronics and its application to the preparation of FGFETs [237]. For example, Cui et al. [238] used a laser platform by tuning the characteristics of the laser to obtain laser-induced graphene with different reduction levels (Fig.11b). The FGFETs were constructed using higher reduction LIG as the source-drain electrode and lower reduction LIG as the semiconductor layer. Individual LIG-FETs can be fabricated by the laser platform in seconds, and LIG-GFET arrays can be constructed in minutes. This device construction method patterns semiconductor layers and electrodes while preparing them, providing a good solution for low-cost, simple processes and large-scale fabrication of FGFETs.',\n",
       "  'In summary, as outlined in Table1, photolithography offers high resolution, capable of achieving micrometer- and even nanometer-scale patterns. Its reproducibility, suitability for large-scale and batch production, and process maturity make it ideal for fabricating high-precision GFETs on rigid substrates. However, the complexity of the process and the high cost of equipment limit its application on flexible substrates, restricting its use primarily to laboratory research and small-scale production of FGFETs. In contrast, soft lithography is characterized by lower cost and a relatively simpler process. Its flexibility makes it suitable for fabricating GFETs on large-area flexible substrates, particularly for low-cost biosensors and wearable devices. However, the lower resolution and pattern consistency of soft lithography render it less suitable for applications requiring high precision. Inkjet and aerosol jet printing techniques offer a non-contact printing process that simplifies production, reduces costs, and provides high flexibility to print complex and diverse patterns, making them well-suited for customized FGFET production. However, these technologies have relatively low resolution and demand precise ink formulation and printing accuracy, limiting their use mainly to sensors, displays, and flexible electronic circuits. On the other hand, laser direct writing technology is capable of producing high-resolution, high-precision patterns without the need for a mask. This technique allows direct pattern writing onto materials, making it ideal for manufacturing flexible GFETs with complex designs. Despite its high equipment costs and slower processing speeds, laser direct writing offers unique advantages in producing high-precision, complex patterns and nanostructures, making it suitable for microelectronic devices and high-end flexible electronics. The integrated application of these technologies effectively addresses the growing market demand for flexible electronic devices and fosters the advancement of the FGFET field and related industries.',\n",
       "  'For conventional FGFETs, the essence of the stress-induced electrical change is the change in graphene structure due to strain on the graphene conducting channel. Strain modifies the lattice structure of graphene, influencing its electrical transport properties and leading to significant changes in electrical coupling [239,240,241]. Theoretical calculations indicate that both symmetric and asymmetric strains can dramatically alter the width of the pseudo-bandgap near the Fermi level [242,243]. Specifically, tensile strain reduces the pseudo-bandgap, while compressive strain increases it. A reduction in the pseudo-bandgap decreases the electronic density of states, making it more challenging for electrons to transition between the conduction and valence bands, thereby increasing graphene’s resistance. In contrast, compressive strain enhances the electronic density of states, which leads to a decrease in resistance. Therefore, graphene with a perfect lattice exhibits a piezoresistive effect. Additionally, asymmetric strain disrupts the symmetry of graphene and can open a bandgap, with the magnitude of this effect being directly related to the direction of the applied strain. For example, when the strain direction is parallel to the C–C bond, a strain of 12.2% causes the gap to widen by 0.486\\xa0eV. When the strain direction is perpendicular to the C–C bond, a strain of 7.3% causes the gap to widen by 0.170\\xa0eV [242]. The continued increase in strain eventually leads to C–C bond breakage and graphene film destruction. Ni et al. [244] simulated the fracture behavior of graphene by molecular dynamics, when the strain direction is parallel to the C–C bond, graphene cracks at\\u2009~\\u200930% of the strain; if the strain direction is perpendicular to the C–C bond, the fracture strain increases to\\u2009~\\u200940%.',\n",
       "  \"However, based on the limitations of the preparation method, true graphene is often not an ideal single crystal, but has a polycrystalline structure containing grain boundaries with various internal defects (excess or missing carbon atoms in the carbon six-membered ring, oxygen-containing functional groups). These grain boundaries and defects will inevitably affect the electronic structure of graphene, making the electrical characteristics of FGFETs different during strain [139,145]. For example, Zhuang et al. [245] utilized CVD graphene to prepare field effect transistor nanosensors. When the bending radius is reduced from planar to 8.1\\xa0mm, the graphene resistance and the Dirac point of the transfer curve undergo significant unidirectional changes in terms of increase and negative shift, respectively. Upon relaxation from the bent state, both the original resistance and the Dirac point are also nearly restored, while the transconductance, which is an important marker of the nanosensor's sensitivity, remains nearly constant at all times (Fig.12a). Joong Gun Oh et al. [145] also used CVD graphene to prepare GFET sensors. The 1-vinylimidazole (VIDZ) monomer with imidazole portion was doped into pV3D3 to form a homogeneous copolymer (p(V3D3-co-VIDZ)) thin film as a dielectric layer by an iCVD process, which suppressed the unintentional p doping in graphene and improved the device performance. The Dirac point and transconductance of the sensor were unaffected by the increase in tensile strain from 0 to 1.28%, and the carrier mobility changed by less than 9%. The sensor was subjected to 1000 reciprocal bending tests with a bending radius of five millimeters and the change in carrier mobility was less than 8% (Fig.12b). Due to its zero-bandgap structure, graphene has a low switching ratio, which limits its utility in digital/logic applications. Yang et al. [246] transferred large-area graphene grown by CVD onto poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) substrates and prepared ultrathin graphene nanomesh (GNM) with considerably narrower neck width (<\\u20093\\xa0nm) and stronger quantum confinement by punching holes in the graphene layer using plasma etching with directly grown mesoporous silica as a template. GNM-based field effect transistors achieve high on/off ratios (up to 1000) and large surface/volume ratios. The on/off ratio decreases only slightly as the bending angle increases from 30° to 120°, and the conformal contact is maintained during bending, curling, and twisting, indicating that the GNM-based field-effect transistor exhibits excellent bending durability throughout the bending process (Fig.12c).\",\n",

The rGO FET strain transducer exhibits ultra-sensitivity in very low strain modes and is capable of detecting tensile and compressive strains as small as 0.02% (Fig.12d) and its ability to respond and relax dynamic tensile and compressive strains very quickly [92]. Moreover, the addition of appropriate dopants such as Al, B, N, S, and Si to graphene can also alter the electronic properties of graphene under strain, improve the sensitivity of graphene to strain, and increase its potential for applications in strain sensing [248].',\n",
       "  'In summary, the choice of graphene raw materials, manufacturing processes, and transfer methods plays a critical role in determining the number of graphene layers, lateral dimensions, internal defects, grain boundaries, and interactions with the substrate when designing and deploying FGFETs. These factors ultimately dictate the strain sensitivity of FGFETs and their suitability for various applications. In general, grain boundaries and defects can affect the transport gap in graphene, thereby enhancing its sensitivity to strain [249,250,251]. Consequently, CVD graphene with fewer grain boundaries and defects exhibits lower strain sensitivity but demonstrates high responsiveness to charged biomolecules. This makes it particularly advantageous for developing highly stable and flexible biomedical sensors. In contrast, rGO, due to its inherent structural defects and the presence of oxygen functional groups, is more sensitive to strain, making it ideal for high-sensitivity applications such as pressure sensors and deformation detection. Furthermore, the strain sensitivity of graphene can be enhanced through doping and chemical modifications, broadening its applications in advanced sensors and wearable devices such as electronic skin and various activity monitors. The versatility and adaptability of FGFETs allow them to meet a wide range of demands, from high stability to high sensitivity. However, achieving this requires careful design and the selection of appropriate graphene materials and processing methods.',\n",

They are also easy to integrate into electronic fabrication processes for \"lab-on-a-chip\" functionality. On the other hand, graphene\\'s excellent electrical, biocompatibility, and mechanical properties make GFETs not only capable of maintaining the biological activity of biomolecules and sensitively responding to changes in them, but also ideally suited for applications that require contact with soft or curved biological interfaces. Thus, FGFETs inherit the advantages of both graphene and field-effect transistors and offer significant benefits as flexible biomedical sensors. These benefits include ease of operation, fast response time, real-time monitoring capability, high specificity and sensitivity, low detection limits down to femtomole and sub-femtomole ranges, and microfluidic integration, as well as being suitable for wearable and implantable applications.

Monitoring biomechanical signals is crucial not only in sports, rehabilitation, and medicine but also in smart device interaction, virtual reality, and ergonomics. By accurately capturing and analyzing these signals, we can better understand and improve human health and behavior. Therefore, FGFETs are widely used to monitor biomechanical signals such as pressure, touch stimulation, joint motion, heartbeat, and pulse.',\n",
       "  'The piezoresistive effect is the most fundamental mechanism for detecting biomechanical signals based on FGFET biomedical sensors. For example, Sahatiya et al. developed a flexible all-paper-based few-layer graphene (Gr)-MoS2FET [130]. When strain is applied, the Gr/MoS2channel deforms under force, leading to resistive modulation of the channel and thus achieving a sensitive response to tensile strain. The integration of graphene not only improves the mobility of this FET but also forms a potential barrier with MoS2, increasing sensitivity to small strains. This sensor, integrated into a human hand, enables wireless monitoring of corresponding hand movements via a smartphone, with applications in wireless wearable electronics, security, and human motion monitoring. Additionally, Paul et al. developed a pressure sensing field effect transistor (PRESSFET) used as a wearable switch based on a crumpled graphene flakes network (c-GFN). The unique crumpled morphology of the GFN results in a bandgap of 800\\xa0meV, enabling the device to have well-defined ON and OFF electronic states as well as a low subthreshold swing. The device is activated by temporal muscles in the temple region of the face, allowing for hands-free control of robotic platforms (Fig.13a).

       "  'Although some FGFETs can be strain-sensitive by optimizing the material design of the semiconductor layer, most of the graphene produced by CVD has fewer grain boundaries and defects, making it insensitive to strain. To use FGFETs for detecting biomechanical signals, it is usually necessary to couple components that are sensitive to strain changes. For example, Khan et al. [162] demonstrated a graphene-based friction electronic touch sensor designed to sense touch stimuli. They utilized a single-electrode mode triboelectric nanogenerator (S-TENG) and coplanar coupling of graphene with co-local coupling of graphene field-effect transistors. When any object (e.g., a human finger) contacts the friction layer of the S-TENG, an electrical charge is generated due to the triboelectric effect [257,258,259]. These charges can be used as the gate bias of the graphene field-effect transistor, regulating its current transfer and effectively detecting touch stimuli from bare and gloved fingers and spatially mapping sphere motion and touch stimuli from multiple fingers (Fig.13b). The application of piezoelectric sensor matrices can reduce system size and weight and provide advanced sensing characteristics including low signal interference, monitoring of multiple parameters, high sensitivity, and high spatial resolution. Therefore, Sun et al. [65] fabricated a piezoelectric-powered active matrix strain sensor array using a combination of a P(VDF-TrFE)-based piezoelectric nanogenerator (NG) and coplanar-gate graphene transistors (GT). In this sensing system, the piezoelectric potential of the NG under externally applied strain is coupled to the graphene channel via an ion-gel dielectric, enabling effective modulation of the channel conductance of the GT. The resulting strain sensor exhibits excellent sensitivity and stability for continuous monitoring of hand movements. Transparent conformal strain sensors fabricated on a rubber substrate were mounted on the hand of a human tester for continuous monitoring of hand movements (Fig.13c).',\n",
       "  'Nevertheless, adding additional piezoelectric or friction electrostatic nanogenerators would undoubtedly increase the complexity and fabrication difficulty of the device [260]. Liu et al. [261] demonstrated piezoelectrically driven strain and touch sensors using mechanically doped graphene and solid polymer electrolytes (SPE). Due to the piezoelectric effect in the SPE, the piezoelectric potential modulates the carrier concentration in the graphene channel when strain is applied. As a result, the Dirac point voltage of the SPE-coated graphene FET (S-GFET) is displaced, and this new doping technique is able to tune the pristine graphene to either an n-type doped state or a p-type doped state for an efficient response to strain. The GFETs exhibit stable output signals at continuous strains and can differentiate between tension and compression without the need for extra components. The strain sensor attached to the hand responds efficiently to hand joint movements and has potential applications in long-term rehabilitation (Fig.13d). Additionally, the device is well-suited for touch sensing, as the friction potential modulates the current transfer in the S-GFET due to the charged contact between the SPE and an external object. Similarly, Park et al. [262] reported a GFET wearable piezoelectric pressure sensor fabricated using vertically aligned, positionally, and dimensionally controllable arrays of ZnO nanotubes grown on a graphene layer. Due to the piezoelectric properties of ZnO, under increasing applied pressure, the piezoelectric field formed across the width of the ZnO nanotubes traps charge carriers and creates charge depletion zones on the curved outer and inner surfaces of the nanotubes, resulting in a systematic decrease in current. The wearable sensor shows high-pressure sensitivity (−\\u20094.4\\xa0kPa−1) and can detect weak inert gas flows. Connecting the sensor to the volunteer’s philtrum and wrist allowed for the detection of respiration and heart rate (Fig.13e). The prototype of the hybrid sensing device holds significant promise as a wearable technology, particularly in the realm of sophisticated healthcare devices.',\n",
       "  'Monitoring body temperature is critical for detecting and controlling diseases, assessing the effectiveness of treatments, and maintaining overall health and well-being [263]. There have been considerable advancements in the creation of GFET temperature sensors. For instance, Trung et al. [133] developed transparent, flexible nanocomposite FETs for temperature monitoring using R-GO/P (VDF-TrFE) nanocomposites. The thermal sensing mechanism of this transparent R-GO/P (VDF-TrFE) nanocomposite FET is explained by hopping and tunneling transport within the material. During hopping transport, the field-effect mobility increases with rising temperature. Consequently, these transparent, flexible nanocomposite FETs are extremely sensitive and can detect temperature changes as small as 0.1\\xa0°C, making them ideal for monitoring human body temperature. To facilitate attachment to human skin as a patch, the group subsequently developed a fully flexible FET temperature sensor based on reduced graphene oxide/elastic polyurethane (R-GO/PU) nanocomposites [66]. This device can detect temperature-induced potential changes in the vicinity of the rGO channel region and exhibits an almost linear response to temperature variations. To mimic the versatility of human skin, the researchers also fabricated an integrated platform of transparent, stretchable temperature and strain sensors in a vertically integrated scheme. This setup, affixed to the neck and arm, concurrently tracks minor temperature fluctuations and muscle motions during human activities (Fig.14a). In addition, Mondal et al. [264] fabricated a pressure–temperature multifunctional sensor using MXene/Fe3O4/graphene porous network/Ecoflex (MFGPNE) FETs (Fig.14b). Based on the piezoresistive effect, the sensor responds sensitively to pressure. The different coefficients of thermal expansion of MXene, graphene, and Ecoflex affect the electrical characteristics of the connected networks during heating or cooling, resulting in a linear temperature response of the sensor. By integrating these two functions, the sensor is expected to excel in wearable sensing devices, enabling simultaneous detection of body temperature and pressure.',\n",

In contrast to wearable sensors used for monitoring physiological signals, these biochemical parameter monitoring sensors offer a broader perspective on an individual’s health status, providing valuable and dynamic molecular-level information [253,271,272].

       "  \"With the emergence of diseases, components such as enzymes, proteins, and antigens that are absent in normal tissues begin to proliferate. Consequently, protein-based targets have become the most commonly used means for accurate disease diagnosis and are widely applied in diagnosing various conditions [273]. To facilitate disease prevention and diagnosis, protein sensors based on FGFETs have been developed, laying the groundwork for wearable sensors. Typically, common FGFET protein assays rely on specific recognition between antigens and antibodies. For instance, Wang et al. [274] developed a flexible biosensor based on an antibody-antigen recognition system, assembled from sunflower pollen (SFP) particles coated with reduced graphene oxide (rGO) (Fig.15a). This biosensor can detect prostate-specific antigen (PSA) in real-time and selectively. Since the isoelectric point of PSA is approximately 6.8, it is negatively charged in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH =\\xa07.4). When the antibody specifically recognizes and captures the PSA, a negative potential gating effect is induced, increasing the density of holes in the rGO@SFP layer, which ultimately leads to an increase in the current. This mechanism enables the quantitative detection of PSA. The three-dimensional hybridized rGO@SFP structure provides a larger surface area for analyte binding, which significantly enhances the sensor's sensitivity by 3–4 orders of magnitude compared to conventional two-dimensional rGO films. Moreover, the rGO@SFP biosensor maintains high sensitivity and selectivity even under bending. Thus, natural biocomposites are expected to be an integral part of flexible and wearable sensors and improve sensing performance sensitivity.\",\n",

[110] developed a graphene-based aptamer nanobiosensor technology for the rapid detection of hemoglobin (Hb) in biofluids. The sensor utilized PASE to immobile amino-modified Hb aptamer G15. Given that Hb has an isoelectric point of 6.86, it is weakly negatively charged at pH\\xa0=\\xa07.4. When the aptamer binds to Hb, its structure folds into a compact and stable morphology, bringing the negatively charged Hb close to the graphene surface. This alters the charge distribution at the graphene-liquid interface, inducing an equivalent positive charge on the other side of the interface and generating free-electron carriers in the graphene body, resulting in a detectable change in the source-drain current. Based on this mechanism, the graphene aptamer nanobiosensor could detect Hb in undiluted serum and urine with estimated limits of detection (LODs) of 10.6 fM (1\\u2009×\\u2009PBS), 14.2 fM (undiluted serum), and 11.9 fM (undiluted urine), respectively (Fig.15b). Additionally, even after 120 cycles of 100% cyclic stretching or one bending cycle with a radius of 100\\xa0mm, the sensor's excellent flexibility and stretchability maintained nearly unchanged signals at each Hb detection concentration.

The sensor formed a continuous network of ultra-long silver nanofibers (AgNFs) prepared by electrospinning technology as source and drain electrodes, with pristine graphene fabricated by CVD technology as the semiconductor layer. This smart contact lens, modified with an immunoglobulin G (IgG) antigen-binding fragment that specifically identifies MMP-9, facilitates real-time quantification of MMP-9 concentration, a biomarker of OSI. In addition, a clear, stretchable heating patch based on AgNFs was integrated into the FET smart contact lens device, which fits comfortably on the eyelid and immediately automates OSI treatment based on detection feedback (Fig.15c). Both the diagnostic and therapeutic functions can be wirelessly controlled via a programmed application software, realizing a technological leap forward for bioelectronic wearable devices.',\n",
       "  \"Cytokines are a class of protein molecules produced by immune cells and other cells, which can act as signaling molecules to transmit information between cells, regulate immune cell activities and interactions, and play a key role in immune responses and inflammatory processes. In general, cytokines are mostly detected by aptamers for specific recognition and capture. Similar to the principle of conventional aptamer-based protein detection, this kind of detection relies on the change of charge density inside graphene caused by the charge of the cytokine itself and the conformational change of the aptamer during the detection process, so as to realize the detection of cytokines. Currently, FGFET biosensors have successfully detected various cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) [245], vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) [275], gamma interferon (IFN-γ) [276], and interleukins [182]. However, for wearable field-effect transistors, achieving good detection is not enough; they must also possess mechanical flexibility to be applied on human skin or implanted in the body, enabling the collection of clinical-grade data. Therefore, Wang et al. [277] fabricated an ultra-flexible stretchable graphene field-effect transistor nanosensor on the 2.5\\xa0μm polyester film. Based on an ultrathin substrate, the nanosensor was able to fit onto the underlying surface (e.g., human tissue or skin surface) and maintained good electrical and sensing properties when deformation occurred. It was able to detect TNF-α protein stably and reliably even under large deformation with a LOD of 5\\u2009×\\u200910–12M (Fig.16a). With these capabilities, the nanosensor holds potential for use in wearable or implantable systems for human health monitoring and clinical diagnostics. Nevertheless, these sensors face limitations in detecting cytokines in physiologically relevant environments, especially in wearable applications, owing to the low concentration of cytokines and the interference of background substances in human biofluids such as sweat, tears, and saliva. To overcome this challenge, this group further developed a flexible and self-regenerating aptameric FET biosensor [278]. This biosensor utilizes a graphene-Nafion composite film to minimize non-specific adsorption and improve the reproducibility of the biosensor. As a result, the device achieved stable, sensitive detection of interferon-γ (IFN-γ) in undiluted human sweat with a detection limit as low as 740 fM (Fig.16b). Moreover, it maintained a consistent sensing response throughout both regeneration (up to 80 cycles) and crumpling (up to 100 cycles) tests. The biosensor offers potential for the creation of wearable biosensing systems that can distinguish between patients with acute infectious diseases and monitor the health status of individuals in their everyday lives. Similarly, Zhang et al. [68] proposed an intelligent adaptor dual-channel graphene-tween 80 field-effect transistor (DGTFET) biosensing device. Benefiting from the differential measurement design and the TWEEN 80 passivation layer, the device can effectively minimize or eliminate erroneous response signals from unwanted background interferences in biofluids, thereby enabling the detection of cytokines (including IFN-γ, TNF-α, and IL-6) in human biological fluids such as serum, saliva, urine, and sweat.

Recently, enzymatic glucose biosensors have attracted great interest due to the high selectivity of enzymes and their rapid response to specific substrates.

       "  'Kwak et al. [281] processed a flexible glucose sensor using CVD graphene, a prime example of an enzymatic glucose sensor. When glucose oxidase recognizes glucose and breaks it down to produce H2O2, the H2O2molecule undergoes direct electron transfer with graphene creating an n-doping effect. In addition, adsorption of this H2O2graphene acts as a source of scattering against mobile electrons and reduces the FET conductance. As a result, the sensor is capable of achieving a sensitive response to glucose. The glucose was detected by bending the flexible sensor to a radius of curvature of 6.625\\xa0cm, and the response signal was highly consistent with that in the planar state. The application of enzymatic biosensors is often hindered by the lack of long-term enzyme stability and low enzyme loading under measurement conditions. To address this issue, You et al. [113] constructed a flexible GFET glucose sensor using silk protein as a device substrate and an enzyme immobilization matrix. Due to the unique structure of the silk protein, it can load more enzymes and maintain their activity, improving the sensitivity of the sensor and enabling it to detect glucose levels in the range of 0.1–10\\xa0mM. The silk substrate is highly mechanically flexible, allowing the biosensor to fit snugly on curved surfaces such as the human wrist (Fig.17b). Furthermore, the silk matrix offers the advantage of adjustable dissolution and biodegradation rates, spanning from hours to years, and produces non-inflammatory amino acid degradation products. These properties make the sensor suitable for use in wearable or implantable biosensor applications, including continuous glucose level monitoring patches. However, while the use of silk protein immobilization increases the enzyme load, its accuracy and stability are still affected by the inevitable enzyme inactivation. It has been shown that pyrene-1-boronic acid (PBA) can induce electrical changes in graphene through specific reactions with glucose, converting it to glucose-boronic acid ester complexes. Specifically, glucose can bind to PBA molecules and convert them from the neutral form to the negatively charged borate form (Fig.17c). The increase in charge density of the PBA molecules leads to an increase in graphene carrier density [282,283]. Based on this, Huang et al. [282] functionalized the channels of graphene GFETs using specific pyrene-1-boronic acids (PBAs) to achieve a non-enzymatic detection of glucose. The sensor is simpler to prepare than the more common enzymatic strategy and offers improved stability and accuracy for long-term glucose monitoring. The device demonstrates high sensitivity and a low detection limit of 0.15\\xa0μM on a flexible polyimide substrate. Additionally, extended storage periods (over 48\\xa0h) have negligible effects on its sensing performance (Fig.17d). The experimental results indicate that the GFET nanosensor maintains good consistency and reliability in glucose detection even after prolonged storage.',\n",
       "  'Graphene-based wearable glucose sensors may be deformed by normal body movements when affixed to the surface of the skin, leading to potential disruption of their electrical signals. Recent studies have emphasized enhancing the mechanical stability of wearable glucose sensors based on graphene. Lee et al. [284] proposed a new method for fabricating graphene FET structures based on a \"kirigami\" pattern-a three-dimensional structure formed by cutting on a two-dimensional sheet, similar to origami (Fig.17e). This Kirigami paper pattern not only normalized the resistance variations resulting from the combination of graphene and metal electrodes in the FET sensor, but also enhanced its mechanical stability. In their experiments, the resistance change at 100% biaxial stretching and 180° bending was less than ≈0.5%. The solution-gated GFET glucose sensor with this multiaxial stretchable Kirigami pattern has a high sensitivity of −\\u200924\\xa0mV dec−1and can effectively measure glucose concentrations from 1\\xa0pM to 1\\xa0mM. In addition, it minimizes motion artifacts, thereby improving the accuracy of glucose concentration measurements. The versatility of this approach allows it to be extended to a variety of other biosensing applications, making it an ideal candidate for wearable biosensors. Furthermore, sample collection is a crucial practical issue for non-invasive wearable blood glucose sensors. Gao et al. [285] have designed a skin-based flexible gel electrolyte graphene transistor (GEGT) for glucose detection. This sensor utilizes glycerol gel instead of traditional liquid electrolytes, which not only conforms better to human skin but also acts as a liquid collector, providing stable testing conditions. After 15\\xa0days, its current response to glucose remained above 85% of its initial value (Fig.17f). Furthermore, when untreated sweat was directly applied to the surface of the prepared device, the measurement results were consistent with those obtained using a commercial glucose detection kit after impurity removal, with an RSD of less than 3%, further verifying the high accuracy of the device in sweat glucose detection. The GEGT sensor shows great precision in detecting sweat and has a responsive performance while being worn, suggesting its promising future in non-invasive smart medical monitoring through wearables.',\n",
       "  'In summary, FGFETs have demonstrated considerable potential in the field of blood glucose detection, offering advantages such as high sensitivity, miniaturization, real-time monitoring, low power consumption, and low cost. However, due to the complexity of the manufacturing process and their sensitivity to environmental conditions, the application of FGFETs remains in its early stages. Despite this, current studies indicate that FGFET sensors have already achieved accuracy comparable to existing optical and electrochemical biosensors [286,287]. It is important to note, however, that traditional electrochemical and chemical blood glucose sensors typically maintain stability for 15–45\\xa0days [286,288,289], with some extending up to 90\\xa0days [287]. In comparison, FGFETs still face significant challenges in maintaining stability during blood glucose detection. To address this gap, efforts should be directed toward optimizing enzyme immobilization techniques, enhancing the surface treatment of graphene, and developing more robust non-enzymatic detection strategies. By doing so, we believe the stability of FGFET sensors will be significantly improved, potentially reaching or even surpassing the performance levels of existing technologies.',\n",
       "  \"Nucleic acids (DNA, RNA, miRNA) are important regulatory molecules that regulate the expression of other functional genes and are involved in various physiological activities as well as the growth and development of organisms, and their expression levels are associated with various diseases and are promising biomarkers for disease progression. Therefore, the study of high-throughput nucleic acid detection technologies is crucial for biological research and clinical diagnosis. Our group has built a customizable Gr-FET biosensor for label-free detection of miRNAs [290]. Unlike other sensors, we designed a special DNA probe. It has 10 adenine bases at the 5' end that can be immobilized on the graphene channel by π-π interactions, while the 3' end recognizes the target miRNA and hybridizes to the miRNA fraction. Since the phosphate carbon backbone of miRNA is rich in negative charge, when the DNA probe specifically recognizes miRNA, the charge transfer between miRNA and graphene realizes n-type doping of graphene, which in turn leads to the left shift of the Dirac point. Based on this mechanism, the Gr-FET biosensor is capable of sensitive detection of miRNA in less than 20\\xa0min without any functionalization and labeling (Fig.18a). In addition, the entire miRNA sensor is constructed on a flexible polyimide (PI) substrate, which exhibits stable performance even after multiple mechanical bends.

       "  \"Cortisol is a key hormone linked to stress, with its levels serving as a crucial barometer for mental health. It is present in tears, sweat, and saliva in large quantities, making it essential to monitor its levels to comprehend the body's hormonal reaction to stress. Zhang et al. [100] modified aptamer probes on flexible liquid-gated graphene field effect transistors (Lg-GFETs) and utilized these probes to capture cortisol molecules. Since cortisol has an isoelectric point between pH5.2 and pH5.4, it is negatively charged under physiological conditions (pH7.35 to pH7.45). When the aptamer traps cortisol, it dopes the negative charge into the graphene channel, which reduces the carrier concentration in the channel, leading to a decrease in theIdsand enabling the detection of cortisol. The flexible salivary cortisol detection platform of this Lg-GFET can fulfill the requirement of immediate salivary cortisol detection and provides an alternative solution for the development of similar wearable home medical devices. Similarly, Ku et al. [291] developed a soft, smart contact lens designed to non-invasively monitor cortisol levels in tears in real-time using a graphene-based FET sensor. In this sensor, cortisol antibodies are used to modify the graphene channel, and upon selective attachment of cortisol, electrons are injected into the graphene channel, resulting in a lower drain current. This lens can detect cortisol levels as low as 10\\xa0pg\\xa0mL−1, a low detection limit. Animal tests using live rabbits and human trials have demonstrated the excellent biocompatibility and reliability of the lens as a non-invasive mobile healthcare solution (Fig.18b). As for practicality, this soft contact lens only needs to integrate the cortisol sensor with a transparent antenna and wireless communication circuits, allowing a smartphone to be the only device required for remote operation of the lens, without hindering the wearer's line of vision. This represents a substantial technological leap forward, merging user-friendly device control with critical health monitoring.\",\n",

       "  \"Alkali metal ions play a crucial role in biological structures and metabolic activities and are extremely important for humans, thus their detection is of great significance [293]. The detection of alkali metal ions is even more challenging because of the requirement of selective functionalized layers. Ion selective membranes (ISMs) have been widely used for the selective determination of ions [294,295]. ISMs depend on the specific characteristics of the ion exchanger, such as valinomycin, which is one of the most commonly used potassium ion carriers that can confer membrane ion specificity [296,297]. Li et al. [297] used valinomycin-based membrane coatings to prepare highly sensitive and selective graphene-based ion-sensitive field-effect transistors (GISFETs) (Fig.19a). The structure of valinomycin, composed of alternating amide and ester bridges, features a unique donut-shaped conformation that enables it to bind metal ions. Due to the size of potassium ions (radius 1.33\\xa0Å) being a perfect match for valinomycin's structure, valinomycin exhibits a very high stability constant (K\\u2009=\\u2009106) for potassium ions compared to other metal ions. Additionally, the valinomycin ion-selective layer possesses specific permeability for potassium ions. Therefore, when the GISFET specifically recognizes potassium ions, they permeate the graphene surface, inducing a higher electron concentration (i.e., reducing the hole concentration in p-type graphene). This shift brings the Fermi level closer to the charge neutrality point, thereby lowering the Dirac point and enabling potassium ion detection. Furthermore, the sensor maintains effective performance in physiological solutions, making it suitable not only for wearable sensing devices but also promising for the development of flexible graphene-based bio-implantable ISFETs.\",\n",

       "  \"Implantable sensors distinguish themselves from wearable devices in their monitoring of physiological and biochemical parameters. These sensors typically offer higher data precision and reliability, with the capability for 24-h continuous surveillance, unswayed by external environmental factors [301]. Post-implantation, these sensors usually operate without user intervention, effectively eliminating user adherence-related issues. Additionally, situated within the internal environment, these sensors are less likely to be affected by external physical interference. Graphene's flexibility allows it to form soft, adaptable interfaces that closely correlate with the mechanical properties of the cells, thereby improving the compatibility and long-term reliability of biological interfaces. This has driven the development of implantable sensing devices. As a result, a variety of FGFETs have been used in recent years for implantable applications, including electrophysiological recording and in vivo neurochemical detection.\",\n",
       "  'Research has also shown that graphene can promote the adhesion and regeneration of damaged neurons, aiding the healing process. Graphene may reduce the proliferation of glial cells around the device and improve coupling with target neurons [302], leading to high-quality electrophysiological recordings [303]. Consequently, various FGFETs have been utilized in implantable applications to record neural activity over the past few years [70,304,305,306,307]. For example, Blaschke et al. [70] successfully used flexible graphene micro-transistors to map brain activity in rats (Fig.20a). The use of solution-gated FETs (SGFETs) made from graphene allows for high-density integration and superior signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in brain activity recordings. Graphene SGFETs can record spontaneous slow waves, visually evoked responses, and pre-epileptic activity in vivo in rats. The SNR achieved by graphene SGFETs is comparable to that of state-of-the-art platinum electrodes, and these transistors exhibit intrinsic signal amplification and bipolar behavior. Furthermore, graphene implants are biocompatible, causing no significant inflammation. Graphene-based SGFET technology potentially paves the way for future high-density neural recording implants, which are crucial for mapping brain activity, understanding behavioral studies, and developing neural prosthetics. Although graphene field-effect transistor arrays meet most requirements for μ-ECoG recordings and offer the potential for developing multiplexing technologies, existing systems still cannot provide the resolution needed to accurately map highly localized brain activities. This limitation arises because the size of connectors increases rapidly with the number of sensors. To address this issue, Schaefer et al. developed flexible graphene arrays. They created flexible graphene SGFET arrays and explored the concept of multiplexed readouts using an external switching matrix. This method not only increased the number of sensors but also significantly reduced the complexity of fabricating devices on flexible substrates, paving the way for scaling up SGFET technology to achieve large-scale, high-density μECoG arrays. Moreover, evaluations of these graphene SGFETs in anesthetized Long Evans rats confirmed the fidelity of broadband signal representation (infra-slow oscillations and local field potentials) during multiplexed operations, with signal quality comparable to state-of-the-art commercial neural sensors. Therefore, apart from their potential as effective neural activity transducers, graphene SGFETs also hold significant promise as foundational components for high-sensor-count multiplexed brain-machine interfaces.',\n",

Cortical spreading depression (CSD) is a gradual wave of nearly complete depolarization in neurons and astrocytes, followed by a phase of electrical activity suppression. While not common in brain physiology, CSD is often induced in individuals with stroke, brain trauma, and migraines. To record ISA in vivo, Masvidal-Codina et al. [308] utilized graphene solution-gated field-effect transistor (gSGFET) arrays to map CSD both on the cortical surface and within the cortex (Fig.20b). Their results demonstrated that graphene transistors provide excellent spatial resolution for mapping ISA and can record a wide bandwidth from low frequencies to the typical local field potential range.

       "  \"Neural probe technology is essential for advancing both basic neuroscience research and brain-machine interfaces (BMIs). Deep intracortical recordings offer detailed insights into neural activity, greatly enriching our knowledge of the neuronal mechanisms underlying behavior. Despite their informative nature, deep probes can provoke inflammation and neuronal damage in the brain due to their invasive nature. In contrast, subdural surface probes have emerged as a non-invasive alternative, positioned directly on the cortical surface. These surface probes capture combined signals from multiple neurons beneath, offering a less invasive approach compared to deep probes. They have found application in clinically diagnosing neurological conditions like epilepsy. To understand the relationship between these two modalities, Du et al. [71] developed flexible dual-modal neural probes based on graphene transistors (Fig.20c). Due to graphene's excellent mechanical properties, these neural probes exhibit stable electrical performance even when bent at 90°, allowing for multi-site recordings from the subdural surface of the rat cortex. Finite element analysis indicated that a tip angle of π/6 facilitates the penetration of neural probes into tissue. Consequently, the graphene transistor-based dual-modal neural probe was successfully used for simultaneous surface and depth recordings of epileptiform activity in the rat brain in vivo. The graphene transistor-based dual-modal neural probe can serve as a simple and versatile tool for studying the spatiotemporal patterns of neural activity. Compared to using single-modal probes, the dual-modal probe based on graphene transistors is easier to implement and allows for direct comparison of surface and depth neural activities.\",\n",
       "  \"The intricate processes of cognition, perception, and action rely on the dynamic neural networks in the brain, governed by a variety of neurochemicals [309,310]. The brain contains over 200 identified neurochemicals, including monoamines (such as dopamine and serotonin), peptides, amino acids, lipids, and other small molecules such as acetylcholine [311]. Imbalances in specific neurochemical levels are linked to various neuropsychiatric and neurological conditions like Parkinson's disease [312], schizophrenia [313], and Alzheimer’s disease [314]. As a result, implantable sensors utilizing FGFET technology have been created to detect these neurochemical substances. For instance, Wu et al. [315] reported an implantable aptamer-graphene microtransistor probe. When dopamine binds, it triggers a structural reorganization of the aptamer, causing p-doping effects on the graphene channel (shift to the right) and boosting the source-drain current through electrostatic effect (Fig.21a). This probe is capable of real-time monitoring of dopamine at near-cellular-level spatial dimensions with high selectivity and picomolar-level sensitivity. In a mouse model, dopamine release in vivo was successfully captured through pharmacological stimulation, suggesting that this neural probe holds promise for applications in basic neuroscience research and the study of processes associated with neurological diseases. Similarly, Gao et al.

Long-term stability is critical to ensuring that the sensor can continuously and accurately monitor biomarkers, as it directly impacts the sensor's ongoing effectiveness. However, maintaining the long-term stability of implantable FGFETs in vivo presents significant challenges. Factors affecting this stability include electrochemical degradation at the graphene-electrolyte interface, adsorption of charged molecules, and fluctuations in the reference electrode potential. To address these challenges, Garcia-Cortadella et al. developed a graphene-based neural probe (Fig.22a) [316]. By employing a 4-inch wafer-level fabrication process, they precisely controlled the doping of the g-SGFET and the homogeneity of the charge neutrality point, successfully ensuring the sensitivity of the sensor array. Additionally, the application of a 1\\xa0mHz high-pass filter effectively reduced the adsorption of charged molecules and mitigated electrode reference potential drift, thus maintaining probe stability over a period of 4\\xa0weeks. Beyond design optimization, surface coating techniques are crucial for ensuring the long-term stability of the sensor. For instance, coating the sensor surface with bio-contamination-resistant materials, such as polyethylene glycol and its derivatives [317], zwitterionic polymers [318], or polyacrylamide hydrogels [319], significantly reduces the effects of bio-contamination, further enhancing sensor stability in complex in vivo environments.

Highly biocompatible materials can significantly reduce post-implantation inflammatory reactions and minimize the risk of immune rejection, thereby improving the safety and comfort of implanted devices. However, most current implantable sensors are still based on polymeric material substrates, which tend to trigger an inflammatory response when implanted in the body [313]. This inflammatory response may damage surrounding tissues, increase the risk of infection, and potentially lead to more serious complications, thus limiting the biocompatibility of existing FGFET implantable biosensors. To address this issue, researchers have begun exploring more suitable alternative materials, such as silk protein (SF). Compared with conventional polymer materials, silk protein not only has superior mechanical properties but also offers excellent biocompatibility and biodegradability [320,321]. Additionally, when SF is degraded by enzymes (e.g., proteases), its by-products exhibit low antigenicity and do not trigger inflammatory reactions [322,323]. Leveraging these advantages, Bonaccini Calia et al. [324] developed flexible graphene deep neural probes (gDNPs) based on silk proteins. In a 12-week chronic biocompatibility test of deep brain structures in adult male Sprague Dawley rats, the gDNPs did not provoke significant inflammatory responses (Fig.22b), indicating that gDNPs possess good biocompatibility and are suitable for long-term implantation into deep brain structures without causing significant tissue damage or neuroinflammatory responses. Furthermore, introducing biocompatible functional groups (e.g., carboxyl groups, amino groups, and polyethylene glycol) on the graphene surface can reduce the toxicity of graphene to cells and tissues, thereby improving the biocompatibility of FGFET-based implantable biosensors. Additionally, coating graphene surfaces with biocompatible materials (e.g., proteins, sugars, lipids, or polymers) can further reduce direct contact with biological systems, thereby lowering potential immune responses and toxicity, ultimately enhancing biocompatibility.',\n",

In addition, in some of the FGFETs that monitor limb movements, they are coupled to nanogenerators, piezoelectric materials, etc., and physiological signals are detected by changes in carriers in graphene induced by the coupling materials during sensing of stress variations. As for the FGFET biosensors for biochemical signal detection, they generally achieve the detection of biochemical signals through the specific binding of probes (antibodies, aptamers, DNA, etc.) and target molecules on the graphene surface. Specifically, when the probe on the graphene surface captures the target molecule, a change in the carrier density inside the graphene is induced by charge transfer or electrostatic induction, which changes the FGFET current and the Dirac point position [160]. In conclusion, most flexible biosensors achieve the detection of physiological and biochemical signals by monitoring the changes of FGFETIdsand the movement of Dirac points. Therefore, we briefly analyze the effect of deformation on theIdsand Dirac points of FGFET biomedical sensors.',\n",

As for the common flexible biosensors for detecting biochemical information, the Δninduced by the biosignals solidly loaded on graphene remains essentially unchanged during deformation. According to the analysis in Sect.3.3, the change in μ induced by deformation is smaller in FGFETs with fewer defects. In addition, the quantum capacitance of graphene changes when graphene is subjected to strain, however, when graphene is subjected to strain within 10%, the change in its quantum capacitance is so weak that it is negligible. The analysis shows that the effect of strain on the current and the Dirac point of the sensor is very weak during small deformation, and the detected signal mainly depends on the effect of biological signals on the electron transport properties of graphene.',\n",
       "  'Based on the above analysis, for flexible biomedical sensors detecting biochemical signals similar to biosensors on solid-state substrates, three aspects of stability, sensitivity and specificity should be addressed to obtain excellent sensing performance. Strategies to improve their stability include optimizing graphene mass, exploiting covalent bonding interactions, and stopping graphene degradation induced by aqueous solutions. To improve the sensitivity, overcoming the Debye length limitation, modifying the graphene surface and utilizing the 3D graphene structure are effective methods. To improve specificity, the use of specialized bioprobes and passivation strategies is also beneficial. Specific measures are detailed in \"Recent Advances in Graphene Field-effect Transistor Towards Biological Detection\" [325], which will not be repeated here. As for flexible biomedical sensors for monitoring physiological signals, improving their sensing performance mainly revolves around increasing the sensitivity to physiological signals, which can be achieved on the one hand by introducing impurity doping and defect engineering, material structure optimization, and composite material design to improve the perception of stress in graphene material itself, and on the other hand, coupling piezoelectric and friction electric effects, designing and fabricating graphene materials with high-voltage coefficients and excellent mechanical properties of materials and coupled with FGFETs. In addition, optimizing the nanostructure design can increase the surface area and stress concentration region, enhance the piezoelectric effect and electronic output signal, and thus improve the sensing performance.',\n",
       "  \"Section2.2's discussion of the mechanical characteristics of FGFETs shows that the maximum strain an FGFET-based biosensor surface can handle is contingent on the selection of materials and the design of the structure, with primary influences being the thickness and relative Young's modulus of the individual components. If the sensor's components are too thick and the Young's moduli of the working layer and the substrate differ significantly, the strain on the FGFET may exceed its failure threshold, potentially causing the graphene conductive channels to fail and the sensor to malfunction. Additionally, higher relative Young's modulus and thicker components can hinder the seamless bonding of FGFET biosensors to human skin or tissue. Therefore, it is crucial to minimize the sensor's thickness during the design and fabrication process. At the same time, while ensuring that the Young's modulus of the working layer is slightly higher than that of the substrate, the Young's modulus of the individual elements should not be excessively low. These considerations are essential for achieving high flexibility and reliable performance of FGFET biosensors under various mechanical deformations, allowing them to accurately measure fluctuations in physiological parameters and biomarker concentrations while adhering effectively to the skin or tissue. For wearable sensors fitted onto the body, the design must prioritize wear-resistance, biocompatibility, and durability to meet a wide array of user demands. On the flip side, for invasive sensors implanted in the body, the design must mitigate invasiveness and discomfort during use. Therefore, it is crucial to develop new substrate materials featuring biocompatibility or biodegradability. It is especially important to investigate conductive polymers composed of proteins or the extracellular matrix, as these materials can support cell growth without triggering an immune response. These considerations not only reduce environmental impacts significantly, but also ensure safety and comfort over extended implantation periods or long-term adherence to the skin.\",\n",

For instance, optimizing the preparation parameters of CVD graphene can effectively reduce material defects, thereby significantly enhancing charge carrier mobility. Secondly, exploring new interface engineering techniques between graphene transmission channels and electrodes is vital. Utilizing novel metal alloys such as palladium-gold alloys or conductive polymers like polypyrrole can yield better contact interfaces, directly aiding in reducing contact resistance and enhancing device performance. Additionally, developing advanced microfabrication techniques to achieve nanoscale lateral dimension control and precise interlayer structure adjustments is crucial for accurately controlling the microstructure of FGFETs, which is paramount for device performance improvement. Lastly, innovative doping techniques provide an effective means to modulate the charge carrier concentration and types of graphene. For example, nitrogen or boron doping can effectively adjust the conductivity of graphene to meet specific requirements for conductivity in different applications.

       "  'Improving the flexibility of FGFETs requires efforts in material innovation and structural design. Firstly, developing new composite materials and nanostructures is crucial, as they enable FGFETs to maintain performance under extreme physical conditions such as significant bending, stretching, and compression. For instance, introducing highly ductile polymers as substrate materials can significantly enhance the flexibility of transistors. Secondly, flexibility can be enhanced by optimizing the geometric layout of transistors. For example, achieving curved arrangements of transistor arrays or using flexible connection designs like serpentine or mesh, or designing stress relief structures, can disperse stress when FGFETs undergo physical deformation, avoiding damage caused by localized stress concentration while maintaining electrical performance and enhancing flexibility. Additionally, optimizing the interface contact between graphene and flexible substrates can significantly increase their adhesion, thereby increasing overall durability and flexibility. This process involves careful selection of interface materials and advancement in processing techniques aimed at ensuring the stability and reliability of FGFETs in flexible applications. For example, atomic layer deposition (ALD) technology can form a uniform and tight interface layer between graphene and substrates, significantly enhancing adhesion between them. Through these measures, the flexibility of FGFETs can be effectively enhanced, making their application in wearable and implantable devices and flexible electronic products more widespread and practical.',\n",
       "  'Due to their lightweight construction, flexible GFET biomedical sensors have brought revolutionary improvements to wearable technology.

By integrating advanced energy harvesting technologies such as triboelectric and thermoelectric technologies, we can not only ensure the persistent operation of FGFET sensors but also expand their applications in remote healthcare and mobile health monitoring. Nonetheless, a major challenge current self-powered sensors face is that the energy conversion efficiency still needs improvement. Capturing energy from the environment and converting it into electrical power may not be efficient enough, causing sensors to not operate stably under all conditions. Additionally, the cost of manufacturing self-powered sensors is high, especially those requiring complex technologies and manufacturing processes to enhance energy conversion efficiency and stability.

       "  \"FGFET multifunctional sensors, capable of simultaneously detecting multiple biological signals such as body temperature, heart rate, blood glucose, and disease biomarkers, will all be integrated into a single flexible device. This multifunctional integration not only helps save device space and lighten the burden on wearers but also provides users with more comprehensive health data, enabling a holistic monitoring of individual health conditions. However, the key to achieving simultaneous detection of multiple parameters in a multifunctional FGFET lies in differentiating between various stimuli. To address this challenge, selective sensing layers can be designed to differentiate between physical and chemical stimuli. Different materials have distinct electrical properties in response to different types of stimuli (e.g., strain, temperature, or chemical changes), which helps isolate and recognize specific signals [264,326]. Additionally, integrating multimodal sensing functionality into the FGFET allows multiple parameters to be measured simultaneously within a single device, further enhancing the ability to distinguish between different stimuli [327,328]. This approach ensures that different signals do not interfere with each other, providing users with more accurate and comprehensive health monitoring data. To further improve the detection accuracy of the FGFET, advanced signal processing techniques, such as inverse convolution algorithms, can be applied to the sensor's output signals. These techniques can effectively separate overlapping signals resulting from simultaneous physical and chemical changes, allowing for more accurate identification and analysis of the primary stimulus [329,330]. Additionally, implementing calibration protocols and compensation algorithms is crucial. These methods not only correct cross-sensitivity between different stimuli but also ensure the purity and accuracy of the desired signal by predicting sensor response models and effectively compensating for the influence of the external environment on the sensing results [331]. While it is essential to differentiate between detection signals and improve accuracy, the portability and comfort of the sensor are equally important. Reducing the size and weight of the sensor is crucial to ensuring that the user is barely aware of its presence during daily wear. Therefore, advancements in miniaturization technologies and system-level integration strategies are necessary to tightly integrate GFETs with other electronic components, creating compact, multifunctional systems. Additionally, to fully utilize the potential of this hardware, intelligent software must be developed to operate the sensors for real-time data collection and analysis. This software would not only handle noise reduction, calibration, and data fusion processing but also transmit the processed data to the device’s display or wirelessly to other devices. As technology continues to advance, multifunctional wearable biomedical sensors are gradually becoming an indispensable part of enhancing people’s quality of life and preventing and treating diseases. With ongoing technological advancements and decreasing costs, it is foreseeable that such products will become more widespread, more convenient, and make a greater contribution to the health of all humanity.\"],\n",
       " 'paper_3.html': ['In the realms of crystal engineering, molecular electronics and supramolecular chemistry, photoinduced phase transitions have attracted great attention as they provide a way to control various photo-switchable functions (e.g. optical properties, conductivity, magnetism, and dielectric response)1,2,3,4,5. Exploring time-resolved molecular structural changes and deformations of the crystallographic lattice (unit-cell symmetry, parameters, volume) during photoinduced phase transitions is critical to understand the pathways through which photoinduced energy is transferred between electronic and vibrational degrees of freedom6. This knowledge provides understanding of the non-equilibrium dynamics on the atomic length scale and the interplay between the intricate processes that govern the behavior of matter at its most fundamental level5,7,8,9.',\n",
       "  'From the perspective of ultrafast structural dynamics, photo-switchable spin crossover (SCO) materials are particularly attractive platforms due to their functional design and tuning versatility on both the molecular and the crystal structure levels10,11. The switching dynamics in SCO nanomaterials following light excitation involve two sequential processes: an ultrafast photoinduced SCO occurring on the sub-picosecond (sub-ps) timescale, followed by a second thermo-elastic SCO step on a longer timescale, in the nanosecond (ns) range6,12,13,14,15,16. The ultrafast photoinduced SCO dynamics has been extensively studied using multiple methods6,13,14,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31and some consensus about the general photoconversion pathways has been achieved, though these pathways are strongly affected by the local coordination environment of the metal centers. Upon photon absorption, the SCO molecule is excited from the low-spin (LS) state into a charge-transfer manifold and then relaxes to a high-spin (HS) state, during which a rapid intramolecular vibrational energy redistribution (IVR) occurs on the hundreds of femtoseconds (fs) timescale16,17,18,22,23,24,31,32. The SCO photoswitching process has been described by qualitatively splitting the reaction coordinate into the symmetric breathing mode of the metal-ligand bonds and local ligand bending mode19,20,25,30. The associated metal-ligand bond length elongation and structural distortions of the ligand provides the possibility of feedback occurring between the expanding lattice volume and molecular spin state6,13. Indeed, through intermolecular interactions in the crystal phase, local excitations can propagate and lead to a global lattice volume change via the propagation of strain waves14,33. In addition, as a large part of the photon energy is transferred to the lattice, a sizeable rise of the lattice temperature occurs on a timescale of tens of ps14,34. The lattice expansion allows a further structural reorganization, eventually yielding a fully relaxed HS structure similar to the thermally-induced HS state35,36. As a consequence, a delayed thermo-elastic driven SCO proceeds on longer timescales (tens of ns), governed by the intramolecular energy barrier between the LS and HS states, since the excitation fraction of molecules equilibrates within the new lattice conformation14,15,16. However, the exact time evolution and interaction between molecular structural rearrangement, photothermal heating, change in the unit-cell volume, and subsequential spin-state switching in (nano-)crystals on ultrafast timescales remains a subject of ongoing debate. More specifically, thermal and elastic (volume change, internal pressure) effects are known to play a crucial role in the lattice dynamics, thus it appears vital to disentangle these different contributions in the out-of-equilibrium switching dynamics of SCO nanomaterials. Understanding these thermo-elastic effects is, however, not sufficient because the SCO process is also governed by local and bulk (whole crystal) energy barriers, which can further perturb the collective electronic and structural rearrangements of the molecules. An important issue is thus to explore how such couplings might facilitate or impede cooperative, fast, and efficient bulk phase transformations13,37, in order to achieve (as for all photoinduced phase transition materials) various photo-switchable functions driven by short light excitations10,11.',\n",

For this model, we used most of the Bragg peaks observed in the UED and XRD results, and the intensity changes observed in 80 Bragg peaks from the UED results, along with 32 Bragg peaks from the XRD results were incorporated. Here, the complementary nature48,51of UED and XRD primarily lies in terms ofq-resolution,q-range, and number of Bragg peaks in different parts of reciprocal space probed. The extensiveq-range and the large number of Bragg peaks in thehk0 family from the UED results improve the spatial resolution of the molecular model and reduce the risks of overfitting that would arise if relying only on the limited number of Bragg peaks in the narrowq-range probed by XRD. In contrast, the Bragg peaks in differenthkl(l=\\u20091 or 2) family from the XRD results allows us to identify inconsistencies or artifacts in the data, improving the reliability and accuracy of the model (Supplementary Note4). The experimental data from UED and XRD provides a robust foundation for modeling and allows us to confidently assign molecular structural dynamics. Additionally, the highq-resolution XRD results reveal a crucial detail: the structural dynamics of photoexcited molecules occur within a constant LT unit-cell volume during the first 2\\u2009ps.',\n",
       "  'The number of degrees of freedom in the model is kept to a minimum by carefully selecting key structural modes to determine the optimal global structure (Supplementary Note4). This approach is based on the symmetric molecular structure of1, theory calculations on low-frequency vibrational modes, and studies of the reaction coordinates and structural dynamics of similar SCO systems18,19,20,25,30. An important aspect is that both UED and XRD probe the ensemble average of all interatomic distance changes within the unit cell. The observed evolution of the Bragg peak intensities reflects correlated atomic motions driven by the photoinduced dynamics. Two independent dynamics groups were defined to decompose atomic motions from the LS ground state to the HS state into a linear combination of two reaction coordinates: symmetric Fe−ligand elongation with rigid ligands (pELO) and ligand rotation toward fully-relaxed HS structure (pROT) (Fig.4a). The symmetric elongation of the Fe−ligand bonds, corresponding to the molecular breathing mode (Supplementary Movie1), is the direct structural fingerprint of the SCO of1due to the population of antibonding orbitals of the iron center in the HS state. It has been widely used as the primary reaction coordinate describing structural change between the LS and HS states18,19,20,25,30. Molecular vibrational frequencies were computed for1in the HS state following geometry optimization (Methods and Supplementary Data1). Among vibrational modes between 70\\u2009cm−1and 200\\u2009cm−1, the frequency of the breathing mode (136.9\\u2009cm−1) is similar to those of other similar SCO systems18,20,30,31. The ligand rotation has the effects of changing the N−Fe−N angles without significantly modifying the Fe−ligand bond distances (Supplementary Movie2). This rotation movement is triggered by the Fe−ligand elongation due to the rigidity of the ligands25,30. Other low-frequency modes, such as ligand torsion (Supplementary Movie3) and out of phase Fe−ligand stretching (Supplementary Movie4), are reported to be irrelevant during vibrational cooling25,30,31.',\n",

In this way, we derive the temporal evolutions of the Fe−ligand distance (average length of Fe−N coordination bonds) and of the ligand rotation (average N−Fe−N angles), as depicted in Fig.4b. These two key structural modes can be related to the fast and slow components observed in the UED and XRD data.',\n",

The second approximately 1.45-ps ligand rotation is accompanied by structural relaxation of the photoexcited (vibrationally hot) molecules in the HS potential well leading to the fully relaxed HS excited state structure14,17,18,22,23,24,31. During this relaxation phase, energy is redistributed to the lattice and other low-frequency modes. In Fig.4b, following the IVR process at +\\u20092\\u2009ps, the measured Fe−ligand elongation is comparable to that observed for HS molecules in HT unit cell, while the ligand rotation is found to be smaller. The structure of the photoinduced HS state at +\\u20092\\u2009ps thus differs to some extent from that found in the thermally-induced SCO due to the internal chemical pressure55from neighboring unrelaxed unit cells, which restrains the structural relaxation of the photoexcited molecules.',\n",
       "  'Our experimental data, with high temporal andq-resolution, unambiguously reveal that the local structural rearrangement of photoexcited molecules takes place within a constant LT unit-cell volume on an ultrafast timescale (<\\u20092\\u2009ps). This critical observation supports our finding of a non-equilibrium state, where the structural relaxation of photoexcited molecules is constrained by the chemical pressure exerted by neighboring unit cells in Fig.4. We further confirm the photoexcited spin dynamics in SCO systems through the direct observation of nuclear rearrangements, combined with electronic dynamics from previous studies that allows for the assignment of the spin states involved14,17,18,22,23,24,31,52,53,54. Notably, our results provide direct insights into how the sequence of atomic motions—Fe−ligand elongation followed by ligand rotation—stabilizes the HS state at the earliest femtosecond timescales. These two atomic motions were previously reported as coupled motions due to the (0.4\\u2009±\\u20090.05)-ps instrument response time of keV UED20, whereas their sequential nature had been suggested by indirect spectroscopic studies25,30,31. Our diffraction data captured the atomic motions of entire molecules, in contrast with previous studies25,30,31that resolved specific vibrational modes and X-ray absorption bands18,30, which mainly focused on changes in metal−ligand distances. The observed sequential atomic motions localized the correlated nuclear motions corresponding to the electronic dynamics on the FeIImetal center, from the initial LS to the HS potential surface20,30,31. The initial Fe−ligand elongation, driven directly by the change in electron configuration, triggers the subsequent ligand rotation due to the ligand rigidity. This rotation is identified as a key mode activated to stabilize the photoexcited molecules during the vibrational cooling, extending beyond the traditionally-studied reaction coordinate of Fe−ligand distances18,31,53,56. As shown in Fig.3d, after +\\u20092\\u2009ps, a subsequent shift in the radial position of Bragg peaks toward lowerqrange is observed, signaling a lattice volume expansion. As discussed later, this global expansion of the unit-cell volume on the picosecond timescale mainly arises from the lattice temperature change as a large quantity of energy is transferred to the lattice during vibrational cooling (vide infra)19.',\n",

In Fig.5b, the relative changes in intensity of selected Bragg peaks for the long timescale show a very similar oscillation as observed in Fig.5a. Specifically, concerning the 020 Bragg peak, the dynamics consist of a rapid increase in intensity on the sub-ps timescale due to ultrafast molecular switching (Fig.3b), followed by an oscillating decrease in intensity on the tens of ps timescale (Fig.5b).',\n",
       "  'While the sample was excited in the MLCT band in single-photon regime (Methods), it is noteworthy that the photon energy (267\\u2009nm, 4.64\\u2009eV) is much larger than the energy difference between the LS and HS states (≈100\\u2009meV). The relaxation of the photoexcited, vibrationally hot HS molecules occurs via IVR and vibrational cooling through energy exchange with the surrounding lattice. As a result, a large quantity of energy is transferred to the lattice, involving the generation of photoinduced stresses in the crystal lattice. The mechanical equilibrium with the environment is then restored via the coherent propagation of acoustic strain waves within the sample, which results in an expansion of the lattice volume. The distinct behaviors observed in Bragg peak positions withl≠\\u20090 andl=\\u20090 in Fig.5ashow that the lattice volume expansion occurs with different dynamics in and out of the sample plane.',\n",
       "  'We globally fitted the oscillations shown in Fig.5a, b(Supplementary Eq.2), resulting in a period of oscillations (Tosc=\\u2009221\\u2009±\\u200915\\u2009ps). As the strain impedance of the film is smaller than that of the substrate, it takes two round trips for the propagating strain to produce constructive interferences (Tosc=\\u20094L/v)15. Given the film thickness (L=\\u2009200\\u2009±\\u200910\\u2009nm), our fitting results withv=\\u20093.6\\u2009±\\u20090.3\\u2009m\\u2009s−1can qualitatively reproduce the observed results in Fig.5a, b. This value ofvis in line with the longitudinal speed of sound (v=\\u20093.0\\u2009±\\u20090.3\\u2009km\\u2009s−1) previously reported15. Therefore, both oscillations in radial position shifts and intensity changes for Bragg peaks withl≠\\u20090 are associated with the acoustic resonance of thin films57along theZcrystallographic direction. These typically arise from an acoustic impedance mismatch, generating back reflecting strain waves at interfaces within the film15. These acoustic phonons modulate the spacing between lattice planes so that the oscillation in radial position of the Bragg peaks reflects a periodic compression and expansion of the lattice. The oscillations in Bragg peak intensity can be attributed to constructive and destructive interferences in diffraction induced by periodic displacements of atoms in the lattice associated with the breathing acoustic propagation along theZcrystallographic direction9,19.',\n",
       "  'For the monoexponential decay of the radial positions of the 200 and 020 Bragg peaks toward lowerq, interfacial impedance mismatch may arise at the borders of laser irradiated surface, or domain boundary in theXYplane. Strain waves propagate at transverse acoustic velocity over distances of a few hundred micrometers of the laser beam waist unimpeded by interferences, hence no oscillations are observed in theXYplane. Therefore, the radial position shifts of 200 and 020 Bragg peaks, which are insensitive to propagating strain waves alongZcrystallographic direction, report the time-resolved lattice dynamical response along theXandYcrystallographic directions. The time constant of the monoexponential decay dynamics shown in Fig.5aclosely aligns with the longitudinal acoustic timescale6,58, which can be estimated asL/v≈\\u200950\\u2009ps for the film analyzed in this study. Our present XFEL results, containing a better temporal resolution than synchrotron scattering experiments14,15, demonstrate that the strain wave dictates the pathway of a long-range volume expansion in the three crystallographic directions. These strain waves also induce changes in the structure factor by modulating the overall atomic positions, leading to observable intensity oscillations for Bragg peaks even withl=\\u20090.',\n",
       "  'It is important to note that, as mentioned above, the specific evolution of theaunit-cell parameter of1offers the opportunity in the present study to disentangle the time-resolved structural changes in the crystal lattice that arise purely from thermal effects and those that are caused by the SCO switching process. Indeed, distinguishing between these two contributions to the changes in the unit-cell volume remains a challenging task14,19,20,29.',\n",
       "  'Interestingly, our results in tens of ps timescale reveal that both 200 and 020 Bragg peaks display a radial position shift towards lowerqin Figs.5a and6a, b. However, a different behavior is expected for these two Bragg peaks upon the LS-to-HS molecular switching (shrinkage alongXcrystallographic direction, but elongation alongYcrystallographic direction)15,44. The fact that both 200 and 020 Bragg peaks exhibit a similar position shift towards lowqvalues shows that, in the present experimental conditions (UV light excitation), the unit-cell volume expansion on this timescale mainly arises from lattice heating (ordinary thermal expansion). An upper limit for the lattice temperature rise of ∆Tlatt=\\u200960\\u2009K can be estimated from the deposited laser power, assuming complete photon energy conversion to heat and neglecting radiative losses (Supplementary Note5). From the experimentally observed lattice expansions at +\\u2009100\\u2009ps (Fig.5a) and the known thermal expansion coefficients along the crystallographic axes15, a temperature increase of about 40\\u2009K can be estimated (Supplementary Note5), which matches the value obtained from the laser fluence. It is worth mentioning that while the estimated ∆Tlattcould bring a global lattice temperature above the spin transition temperatureTC, in Fig.5bthere are no discernible changes in intensity of Bragg peaks associated with further molecular switching (i.e., no substantial increase in fractional population of photoexcited HS molecules (∆XHS)), other than the oscillations due to propagating strain waves. This observation aligns with findings from complementary transient absorption spectroscopy and XRD studies of films of115,16, showing a constant ∆XHSon this sub-nanosecond time domain after the initial photoinduced SCO.',\n",
       "  'On the other hand, on the tens of ns timescale, substantial changes in intensity and position of Bragg peaks are observed in the difference pattern at +\\u200937\\u2009ns (Fig.6a–e). In particular, our results reveal that the radial position of the 200 Bragg peak (Fig.6a), which was initially shifted towards lowerqatt=\\u2009175\\u2009ps (compatible with ordinary thermal expansion), is found to be shifted towards higherqvalues att=\\u2009+\\u200937\\u2009ns (meaning a decrease of theaunit-cell parameter). Therefore, along with the above-mentioned specific evolution of the unit-cell parameters of115,44, this drastic change in the position shift of the 200 peak clearly indicates an additional switching of a large fraction of molecules into the HS state. This so called thermo-elastic SCO step, occurring in the ns timescale, is delayed compared to the lattice expansion due to the existence of an energy barrier between the LS and HS states at the molecular scale, as discussed in previous studies14,15,16. In addition, other Bragg peaks, including 020, 131, and 042 reflections, display a further position shift towards lowerqat +\\u200937\\u2009ns, indicating an additional increase of thebandcunit-cell parameters compared tot=\\u2009+\\u2009175\\u2009ps, which is compatible with a noticeable thermo-elastic SCO step. The changes in unit-cell parameters at different time delays are summarized in Table1. In Fig.6, the deviations between the photoinduced difference at +\\u200937\\u2009ns (red) and the thermally-induced difference (black) are thought to arise from the mechanical stresses expected in the out-of-equilibrium state at +\\u200937\\u2009ns, due to an inhomogeneous distribution of unit cell volumes (Supplementary Fig.9). As estimated from the structure factor of Bragg peaks, the fraction of photoswitched HS molecules is found to reach 53 % at +\\u200937\\u2009ns (Supplementary Note6). This delayed thermo-elastic SCO step occurs since the fraction of HS molecules equilibrates with the new lattice conformation, predominantly due to the transient increase of the lattice temperature. On the thermal spin-transition curve15at equilibrium, the estimated value of ∆XHS(53 %) corresponds to a temperature increase of approximately 40\\u2009K from room temperature. This aligns well with the observed increases of theaandbunit-cell parameters at +\\u2009100\\u2009ps and with the value of ∆Tlattestimated from the laser fluence (60\\u2009K), reaffirming the thermally activated nature of this delayed switching step.',\n",
       "  'Our present study of the dynamic lattice response shows that although both molecular switching and lattice heating are known to be responsible for lattice volume changes in thin films of1at equilibrium, their respective contributions are different in different timescales after photoexcitation, as revealed in Figs.5and6. The experimental results suggest that during the ultrafast timescale (<\\u20092\\u2009ps), the photoinduced molecular switching does not trigger any lattice dynamics, and no significant lattice heating is observed during this period. Subsequent to ultrafast photoswitching, the lattice heating becomes dominant in terms of lattice volume change on the timescale of several to hundreds of picoseconds, owing to the high photon energy required for MLCT excitation. However, as a consequence of the energy barrier existing between the LS and HS states at the molecular level14,15,16,25, a significant proportion of LS molecules is switched to the HS state only over nanoseconds (during the thermo-elastic SCO step), so that the main contribution to the lattice deformations at this timescale becomes the substantial thermally activated molecular switching.',\n",

       "  'The state of the plasma is influenced by the laser-beam wavelength, intensity and pulse duration. Energy from a nanosecond laser pulse, for example, could be absorbed by the same plasma that the pulse generated because the time needed for ablating, atomizing and exciting the material (less than 1\\u2009ns) is shorter than the duration of the laser pulse. However, for a femtosecond laser source, the beam interaction with the sample and the plasma formation occur on different timescales, and thus the interaction between the laser radiation and the plasma is moderate or negligible. In all cases, once the plasma is formed, on the scale of a few hundreds of nanoseconds it rapidly changes its temperature, density and degree of ionization, losing energy owing to its expansion into the surrounding environment and the emission of radiation.',\n",
       "  'From a spectroscopic point of view, the complexity of LIBS spectra is directly related to the complexity of the laser-induced plasmas, whose optical emission depends on the ablated mass, the plasma electron number density and temperature, and the degree of ionization achieved. The determination using LIBS of the elemental composition of a sample rests on the spectral analysis of the radiation emitted by the plasma — obviously the quality of the analysis depends critically on knowledge and control of all the factors that might influence the plasma conditions. It must also be remembered that the spectral emission of a laser plasma changes very quickly during the plasma lifetime: this emission can be exploited for analytical purposes only in a narrow window of a few microseconds, not too close to the laser pulse, to avoid the strong continuous emission of the plasma, but not too far, to maintain a favourable ratio of signal to continuum.',\n",

These optical systems typically include lenses and mirrors to focus the laser beam and achieve highirradianceat the ablation point, facilitating the atomization and excitation of the ablated material. Optical systems used in LIBS must have several key features to ensure the optimal performance of the technique: high transmittance, good optical quality, and adequate focusing and collimation capacity.',\n",

They must also be able to withstand the radiant flux of the laser beam and have optically clean, high-quality surfaces to minimize distortion and energy loss of the laser beam. The optical system must be capable of focusing the laser beam onto a small spot on the target to achieve high irradiances, as well as collimating the beam to maintain its size and shape throughout its path. In a typical LIBS experiment, the diameter of the laser beam spot on the target surface can be in the range 100–500\\u2009μm, depending on the laser-beam wavelength, focusing optics and pulse energy.',\n",

This particular capability of LIBS can be exploited to perform stand-off analysis8,9, enabling real-time determination of the elemental composition of materials located in difficult-to-access or high-risk areas. The maximum distance for this kind of analysis is determined by the characteristics of the optical system, but it is also limited by environmental factors such as the presence of dust or smoke, or atmospheric conditions that can interfere with the plasma emission and light collection.',\n",

In some situations, however, measuring chambers are used to provide a controlled environment for plasma ablation and formation to obtain accurate and reproducible analytical results. The chambers can operate in a vacuum, at atmospheric pressure or in controlled atmospheres (for example, with specific gases such as argon or helium)10,11,12,13. They have optical windows that allow the passage of the laser pulse towards the target and the collection of the light emitted by the plasma: these windows must be transparent to the wavelengths of the laser beam and the spectrum emitted by the plasma. Measuring chambers can also be used to ensure gas exchange in the interaction region to remove residual materials from prior ablation and to avoidcross-talkbetween a sequence of laser pulses. Some chambers include positioning and movement systems to precisely position the target and enable ablation at different points.',\n",

There are several types of spectrometers used in LIBS experiments, each with its own advantages and disadvantages.',\n",

These spectrometers are coupled with linearcharge-coupled device(CCD) orintensified charge-coupled device(ICCD) cameras to capture the spatially dispersed light and record the LIBS spectra. Czerny–Turner spectrometers are available in many different sizes and configurations. They can be optimized for high-spectral resolution analysis in a narrow spectral region or to achieve lower spectral resolution on a wider spectral region. In LIBS analysis, compact Czerny–Turner spectrometers are often used, equipped with multiple dispersive elements, capable of covering the whole wavelength range between 190\\u2009nm and 1,000\\u2009nm, with spectral resolutions of the order of 0.1–0.3\\u2009nm.',\n",

In Echelle spectrometers, the light is dispersed by a metallic diffraction grating into many orders that are then spatially separated using a prism into a bidimensional pattern. The pattern is acquired using ICCD cameras, which have high sensitivity. They are especially useful for detecting weak signals and are capable of capturing spectra within integration times of the order of nanoseconds — essential for the analysis of transient plasmas. Using a delay pulse generator, it is possible to control the time between the output of the laser pulse and the start of the ICCD camera recording. Echelle spectrometers are typically larger and more costly than the compact, multiple-grating Czerny–Turner spectrometers, which hence are generally preferred for applications outside the laboratory14.',\n",

There are also other kinds of spectrometer for LIBS: the most used alternative configuration is probably the Paschen–Runge scheme, in which a set of photomultipliers is placed on the Rowland circle to collect the light emitted at the characteristic wavelengths of the elements of interest.',\n",
       "  'One of the most appreciated features of LIBS is the capability to operate on untreated targets in solid, liquid or gaseous states. Constraints on the kind and size of the targets do not therefore derive from the limitation of the technique, but rather from the specific characteristics of the experimental set-up. If measurements are performed in an ablation chamber, for example, the dimension of the chamber will be the limiting factor for the size of the target.',\n",
       "  'In the case of LIBS measurements on liquids, the laser beam can be focused directly onto the surface of the liquid sample. Care must be taken to avoid generating waves on the surface or splashes that can reach the focusing and collection optics15. Alternatively, the measurements can be done on an aerosol or liquid jet to improve performance16. However, the simplest approach is to change the liquid matrix to a solid one17,18,19,20by freezing it or drying the liquid on a substrate21.',\n",
       "  'An example of this approach is surface-enhanced LIBS (SENLIBS), introduced in 2013 to improve the analytical capability of LIBS in liquid samples22. Here, a droplet of liquid is deposited on a metallic or semi-conductive target and left to dry for a few minutes; the laser beam is then focused on the dried droplet and the spectrum is collected as in a regular LIBS analysis of a solid target. The conducting nature of the substrate produces a denser and hotter plasma, increasing the signal of the analyte. Using SENLIBS, heavy-metal pollutants such as lead and chromium can be detected in aqueous solution at concentrations lower than 0.01\\u2009mg\\u2009ml−1(ref.23). SENLIBS can be effectively coupled with a preconcentration stage of the analyte to further improve the sensitivity of the method.',\n",
       "  'Another viable approach is to prepare a pellet by mixing the liquid with a powder that does not contain the analyte and or have emission lines that would interfere with the analysis — such as pure KBr, when potassium or bromine are not present in the liquid samples. The powder is then pressed to create a solid pellet on which the LIBS analysis is performed. The KBr method can also be used for compacting targets in powder form.',\n",

The laser-pulse irradiance must be high enough to generate a plasma from the gas; thebreakdownthreshold in gases is higher than the ablation threshold in solid materials. To increase the irradiance of a laser pulse with a given power, it is necessary to reduce the dimensions of the laser beam spot at the focus, which is done by increasing thef-number of the focusing system, defined as the diameter of the lens divided by its focal length. A highf-number optical system, using two elliptical mirrors for focusing and collection of the LIBS signal, has been used to measure of the ratio of hydrogen to deuterium in a gas24. An exhaustive review of the many possible treatments that might be useful in LIBS analysis is available in ref.25.',\n",

Raw LIBS data contain a huge amount of information; however, not all of it is essential for an analysis: a preprocessing step is necessary to use these data effectively in obtaining qualitative and quantitative information about target composition. Preprocessing involves removing unwanted signals such as background signals,electron continuum emission, noise and instrument contributions; the presence of these signals can greatly reduce the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Recent advances in numerical algorithms have led to the development of improved preprocessing techniques for identifying and removing the main spurious signals in LIBS spectra26.',\n",

Generally, this wavelength calibration is done using low-pressure gas discharge lamps, such as a mercury–argon lamp.',\n",

However, even after such a selection, the number of relevant spectral features can still be quite large.

To overcome this problem, measuring the Stark broadening of the hydrogen Balmer alpha line (wavelength 656.3\\u2009nm) has been proposed62,63.

Multivariate methods can be based on linear models (the concentration of one element in the target is determined as a linear combination of some relevant feature of the LIBS spectrum, for example, the intensities of the emission lines of all the elements present in the target) or, more generally, nonlinear models can be considered, to link the dependent variables (element concentrations) to the independent ones (intensity of the emission lines). The most-used linear multivariate algorithm is the partial least squares approach. Among nonlinear multivariate techniques, one of the simplest, most robust approaches is based on the use of artificial neural networks. The multivariate methods offer notable advantages in terms of quantitative accuracy, robustness and the ability to deal with heterogeneous targets67.

The fundamental challenges of representative sampling by laser ablation must be carefully addressed when applying LIBS to heterogeneous materials. To ensure plasma homogeneity, several researchers have conducted spatially resolved studies78,79and found that the most accurate CF-LIBS results come from emissions in the central region of the plume.

In the process called 2D mapping, the target is placed on a motorized translation micropositioner, moving onxandyaxes and synchronized with the output of the laser pulse117, so that the target moves according to a pre-established program under the focused laser beam. In this way, it is possible to analyse the distribution of the different elements that compose the target.',\n",
       "  'By applying successive pulses to the same spot on the target, elemental composition can be determined at different depths: several consecutive laser pulses can ablate non-representative surface layers to prepare a deeper target surface, for analysis of the underlying bulk material. The depth of the surface crater generated in this way depends on the number of pulses applied, hence it is possible to construct a depth-versus-pulse-number calibration curve to determine the ablation rate. The depth of the crater can be measured after each laser pulse, or layered materials of known layer-thicknesses can be ablated and the changes in the LIBS spectrum observed as a function of the number of consecutive pulses sent to the target118. The depth of the crater can be controlled by changing the laser beam irradiance. The spatial resolution is mainly set by the diameter of the crater.',\n",
       "  'A potential problem in this 3D LIBS mapping, however, is the possible variation of the ablation rate from one point to another on the target surface due to changes in the physical properties of the surface. Changes in colour, reflectivity, density and so on, can affect the absorption of the laser pulse energy and, consequently, the ablation rate. This problem (which is in common with other laser-based elemental techniques such as ‘laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry’ or LA–ICP–MS) might, in principle, produce distorted 3D maps. However, in most cases, the ablation rate does not change markedly across the target surface, and 3D elemental mappings can be made with depth resolutions on the scale of a few tens of nanometres.',\n",
       "  'Over the past 20\\u2009years, there has been progress in the application of the LIBS technique to biological targets, in particular animal and human soft tissues119,120. LIBS is useful for detecting the presence of some metals, thus providing useful information in the study and diagnosis of some diseases, as well as providing a rapid way to separate healthy tissue from diseased tissue121,122. Metals are used not only as diagnostic agents, but also as therapeutic agents (for example, platinum) or associated with radiotherapy (gadolinium)123. An interesting development is a method called tag-LIBS, which detects protein biomarkers for tumour diagnosis124. This involves labelling nanoparticles of, for example, titanium and iron with antibodies that bind to specific biomarkers. The fact that no pretreatment of the target is required undoubtedly facilitates the application, but it is important to select an appropriate substrate to avoid potential contamination. Dried or lyophilized samples showed a better SNR125. In this field of application, LIBS elemental mapping is the most functional approach as the samples are not always homogeneous and it is essential to obtain information on the distribution of elements within the soft samples with micrometre resolution118,126,127.',\n",
       "  'Geology and mining have, for many years, been favoured development grounds for the LIBS technique, with applications to the analysis of iron and copper ores128and bulk minerals129. These fields have benefitted particularly from LIBS portable hand-held instrumentation130and fast micro-LIBS imaging methods131,132(ELEMISSION\\xa0LIBS technology). The development of new robust and efficient chemometric tools has further extended the use of LIBS in geological and mining applications133,134,135. An extensive review of LIBS geological applications can be found in ref.136.',\n",
       "  'The versatility of the LIBS technique is attractive for heritage applications137,138,139,140. Often the objects to be analysed cannot or must not be moved, so a technique capable of at-distance measurements, in situ and without treatment is attractive for this purpose141. LIBS cannot, however, be considered a non-destructive technique because a small part of the target (a few µg) must be ablated to obtain useful information. Nevertheless, the invasiveness of the technique is considered minimal and often easily tolerable, especially when LIBS is coupled with other techniques to optimize its use142,143,144,145,146.',\n",
       "  'Another interesting aspect of LIBS is its ability to make in-depth measurements, a sort of stratigraphy147. Compared with sampling, this approach allows information to be obtained about all the underlying layers with minimal loss of material. It is particularly useful in the case of archaeological bronzes, which have a superficial patina, to access to the bulk148,149. It can also be used to monitor recovery or cleaning processes150. Applications in underwater archaeology deserve specific mention: in this difficult environment, LIBS is often the only analytical technique that can be used successfully. It is still necessary to overcome the difficulties associated with the presence of a liquid medium (which, as reported above, is not particularly favourable to the technique) and often to face the challenge of measuring distant objects151.',\n",
       "  'Among the most surprising applications of in situ LIBS in the past decade is its use in missions to analyse the surface of Mars, specifically the NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration) Curiosity and Perseverance rovers in 2011 and 2020 (refs.152,153), and the Chinese Zhurong rover in 2021 (ref.154). All of these rovers are equipped with mobile laboratories for imaging and for chemical and mineralogical analysis of rocks on the surface of Mars, and include LIBS set-ups that can be used for elemental analysis at a distance of up to 7\\u2009m from the rover itself155. These instruments are also used for deep rock profiling, one of the most difficult challenges in the hostile Martian environment. The LIBS technology has performed brilliantly so far. A large amount of data has been collected and needs to be carefully analysed, providing an important opportunity to test new and more powerful machine-learning techniques156,157. In the near future, LIBS could be employed in asteroid exploration and mining, as well as for the exploration of the Moon and Venus.',\n",
       "  'LIBS is used inside nuclear fusion reactors158, to analyse the components of nuclear fuel (hydrogen, deuterium and tritium) and to monitor plasma-facing components. These components — made of materials such as tungsten, beryllium and carbon — are subject to the plasma–wall interaction (the exchange of energy and mass between the plasma and the walls of the reactor) and are susceptible to erosion and re-deposition159,160. In the case of fission, LIBS is commonly applied for the detection and quantification of uranium, thorium and lithium, which are employed in fission reactors often as fluoride salts (UF4, ThF4and LiF). Robotic arms are used to remotely control the LIBS instrument inside a reactor161,162,163.',\n",
       "  'Another approach to the analysis of nuclear materials is laser ablation molecular isotope spectrometry (LAMIS), a direct and rapid technique for isotopic analysis of optical emission from laser-induced plasmas164, which can be considered to be a variation of the LIBS method. In fact, LAMIS can be performed without sample preparation at atmospheric pressure in the open air or in inert buffer gases. From an experimental point of view, the hardware components required are essentially the same as for LIBS — hence it is possible to perform elemental and isotopic measurements using the same instrumental set-up. LAMIS measures molecular emission as the plasma cools, when free molecules are formed in the plasma. The corresponding molecular bands observed in the spectrum are shifted in wavelength depending on the isotope. This isotopic shift is larger in molecular spectra than in atomic spectra; for example, radicals11BO and10BO have an isotopic shift of 0.73\\u2009nm in the band around 255.5\\u2009nm, compared with the 0.002\\u2009nm shift of the boron atomic line at 280.89\\u2009nm. So far, the detection of several isotopes (H, B, C, N, O, Cl, Sr and Zr) in laser ablation plumes has been demonstrated165. Although the LAMIS method is only applicable in instances where the isotope shift and the concentrations of both isotopes are large enough for LIBS to detect them, using molecular emission as a proxy for determining elemental amounts can be helpful for analysing elements that are hard to detect using standard LIBS.',\n",
       "  'Despite this range of applications and the successes of recent years, LIBS has yet to reach its full potential and become widely accepted as a routine approach to laboratory analyses. Indeed, as a consequence of the low level of standardization between different laboratories, instruments and manufacturers166, the sensitivity, reproducibility and trueness are still perceived to be limiting factors of LIBS, compared with more conventional techniques167. To assess the capabilities of an analytical technique in the most objective way possible, it is typical to define several figures of merit that can provide a reference of the performance of a technique in a specific application using a series of common parameters. For LIBS, owing to the peculiarities of the technique1, the most crucial figures of merit are probably the limit of detection (LOD), precision and trueness.',\n",
       "  'In analytical chemistry, the LOD represents the lowest concentration of an element that can be detected in a sample with ‘reasonable certainty’. In LIBS, LODs are generally reported in ppm or higher for many elements of interest. In 1975, the International Union for Pure and applied Chemistry (IUPAC) proposed a simple formula for estimating the LOD based on the slope of the calibration curve and the standard deviation of the signal from blank samples168. According to the IUPAC definition169, for a Gaussian distribution of blank measurements, the minimum detectable signal corresponds to three times the standard deviation (3σ), ensuring a 95% certainty level against false positives (fluctuations of the blank signal that are mistaken for the signal emitted by the analyte). The IUPAC formula can substantially underestimate the LOD in LIBS applications66,170,171because it assumes the availability of many reference targets and suitable blanks, as in classical chemical analysis, where the analyte is dissolved into a solution that can be diluted progressively. Hence this approach is often inadequate in LIBS analysis of untreated solid targets owing to the limited number of matrix-matched reference standards typically available and the difficulty of obtaining a reliable blank for determining the fluctuation of the signal in the absence of the analyte. A recent paper171emphasized the importance of adopting a new definition and of following rigorous experimental procedures to accurately calculate the LOD, whether using univariate or multivariate methods. Accurate calculation of detection limits in specific applications is still a major challenge in LIBS analysis.',\n",
       "  'The repeatability, or precision, of LIBS measurements is a critical parameter. Generally a LIBS analysis consists of a series of spectra registered from the same target, generated by consecutive laser pulses (on the same spot or adjacent areas), and precision is expressed as the relative standard deviation (RSD) between the spectra. Many factors can introduce instabilities in the pulse-to-pulse reproducibility of the LIBS spectra, some of which are inherent to the instrumentation (fluctuations of the laser radiant flux, plasma instabilities and so on) and others are related to the nature of the target (such as inhomogeneity, a change in temperature or refractive index). Indeed, some LIBS studies report RSD values up to 30%. To mitigate this aspect, the most widely accepted (and applied) solution is to accumulate and average a large number of LIBS spectra. It has been shown that the percentage RSD can drop from almost 20% for a sample of 10 spectra, to around 3% for 50–500 spectra172.',\n",
       "  'Trueness (or correctness) expresses how close the obtained value is to the true or accepted value. In LIBS, trueness is directly connected to instrumental and experimental parameters, as well as to the interaction of the laser radiation with the target. It is also correlated with the interpretation of the obtained spectra and the chosen calibration strategy.',\n",
       "  'Finally, it should be noted that there is large variability in how LIBS data are reported in published works. Ideally, all information should be presented that pertains to the LIBS system used (laser-beam wavelength, pulse duration, fluence or irradiance, and sampling spot size) and to the experimental conditions (type of target and its pretreatment, number of cleaning and sampling laser pulses and their position, and the presence of a controlled atmosphere). Additionally, the characteristics of the light collection and analysis system (spectrometer and detector types, spectral range and resolution, acquisition delay and integration time) should also be detailed, as these too can strongly influence the characteristics of a LIBS spectrum.',\n",
       "  'LIBS researchers have become increasingly aware of the importance of correct reporting of their analytical results. In this regard, the proficiency tests organized166on standardized LIBS datasets have considerably helped in establishing rigorous presentation of LIBS results to the analytical chemistry community.',\n",
       "  'One of the advantages of the LIBS technique is the minimal preparation required for an analysis173,174. LIBS can provide information about an object without complex preparation, which makes it excellent for qualitative analysis. Quantitative analysis, however, is more complicated, because spectral lines are strongly influenced by experimental conditions such as pressure, energy of the laser pulse, delay time, gate time, surrounding media, the matrix and so on. In this case, it is necessary to carefully consider the experimental conditions of the plasma generation and the physicochemical properties of the target, to obtain the best SNR for the LIBS spectra. However, control of all of the parameters can be a challenge175,176,177,178.',\n",
       "  'Enhancing the signal in LIBS is crucial for improving sensitivity, accuracy and detection limits. Several methods have been developed to achieve this goal. A common method is double-pulse LIBS, where two laser pulses are sent to the target in rapid succession. The first pulse ablates the target and creates a shock wave that allows the second pulse to propagate in a low-density environment, reducing the laser–plasma interaction and leading to an enhancement of the emission intensity from the analytes. This technique enhances signal strength and improves detection limits compared with single-pulse LIBS179,180,181,182.',\n",
       "  'Modifying the ambient gas environment can similarly enhance LIBS signals. The use of argon as ambient gas, instead of air, can increase plasma temperature and stability. Argon, owing to its smaller thermal conductivity and specific heat, helps in prolonging the emission lifetime and increasing the plasma electron temperature and electron number density. Despite the lower ablation rate, LIBS analysis with argon at lower-than-atmospheric pressure produces a higher emission signal than using air at atmospheric pressure13.',\n",
       "  'Another, very promising method for enhancing the LIBS signal is called nanoparticle-enhanced LIBS (NELIBS)183,184,185. In this technique, nanoparticles, usually metal based (such as gold or silver), are deposited on the target surface before the laser ablation process. During ablation, the presence of nanoparticles enhances the signal by several orders of magnitude compared with the standard LIBS spectrum. The interaction of the local electromagnetic fields of the nanoparticles and the laser pulse leads to a more efficient breakdown of the material and stronger plasma emission. NELIBS has promising applications in areas that require high sensitivity, as contamination of the target is minimal and preparation of the target is straightforwards. Furthermore, there are reports of NELIBS used in the analysis of molecular bands, which represents an improvement of the LIBS technique in molecular analysis186,187. It should, however, be noted that the reproducibility of NELIBS is in general poorer than that of standard or double-pulse LIBS because of the difficulty of creating a reproducible layer of equally spaced nanoparticles. Moreover, the need for close interaction with the target excludes the use of the technique at a distance, which is commonly considered one of the most interesting features of LIBS.',\n",
       "  'In some cases of LIBS analysis, adjusting the laser parameters — using, for example, shorter (ultraviolet) wavelengths in polymer and organic material analysis — and optimizing pulse durations (femtosecond or picosecond)188can stabilize the ablation process and the subsequent plasma formation, leading to a better quality of spectral signal. Through these improvements, LIBS has the potential of becoming a more powerful and versatile tool for elemental analysis, capable of detecting lower concentrations and providing more accurate quantitative results.',\n",
       "  'Miniaturizing LIBS instruments and integrating them with portable platforms enhances field applicability, in what is commonly called transportable LIBS. Transportable LIBS enables rapid elemental analysis of diverse targets in situ, useful in fields such as environmental monitoring, archaeology, dangerous-materials detection and so on189,190,191,192. However, size and weight constraints on transportable LIBS systems can limit the analytical performance of this instrumentation. Additionally, it can suffer from spectral interferences and matrix heterogeneity, which affect measurement precision. Optimization strategies involve improving laser energy delivery, enhancing spectral resolution and developing advanced data processing algorithms.',\n",
       "  'In a paper published exactly 20\\u2009years ago, Winefordner et al. compared the LIBS technique with the analytical ‘superstars’ of the time — atomic absorption, inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy and ICP–MS — and concluded that “Despite the current, well-deserved, interest of the analytical spectroscopic community, it is only fair to say that LIBS is not the cure for all analytical problems involving rapid, in situ, qualitative and quantitative elemental and molecular analysis of all species of environmental, industrial, forensic and biological importance”193.',\n",
       "  'This analysis is still valid. However, some interesting routes to new applications have since opened, especially for the use of LIBS in the field, where other analytical techniques cannot be used. No other technique is capable, as LIBS is, of performing fast and contactless elemental analysis over a free distance in hostile environments; of analysing industrial processes, and also the sorting and recycling of waste materials; and of analysing the environment of planets millions of kilometres from Earth, as proved by the three LIBS instruments currently operating on Mars.',\n",
       "  'LIBS also is perfectly suited for geological analysis. Hand-held LIBS instrumentation promises to become a game-changer for in situ prospecting because of its capability in detecting and measuring light elements that cannot be analysed using other competitive techniques, such as X-ray fluorescence (XRF)194. Even in other applications where XRF is known to give excellent results, LIBS is gaining attention because it does not use ionizing radiation and can perform stratigraphic analysis (although microdestructively), which XRF cannot.',\n",
       "  'Portable LIBS instrumentation could be used in the analysis of microplastics in the environment, a topic that has attracted some attention within the LIBS community115,116. With respect to other techniques for in situ identification and classification of microplastics, mostly based on infrared molecular spectroscopy, LIBS has a clear advantage in terms of speed of analysis. Moreover, LIBS can also give an estimation of the metal accumulation on the surface of microplastics, information that is not accessible using other techniques.',\n",
       "  'The development of LIBS as an analytical laboratory technique is more challenging to predict. From the recent LIBS literature, it is not easy to discern the potential for major breakthroughs, and use of LIBS has not yet achieved the level of consensus among researchers that other established laboratory analytical techniques have. It should be noted, however, that it is difficult to compare results obtained using LIBS — a technique that analyses a target on the scale of a few micrometres — with those measured using other analytical techniques on homogenized targets, obtained by grinding the samples or dissolving them in solution. Some prejudice about the poor reproducibility of LIBS might be associated more with the inhomogeneous nature of the targets analysed than with any intrinsic weakness of LIBS. When the analytical request is for average compositions, LIBS operators must be aware that the high spatial resolution of the technique comes at the cost of poor representativity of the results, in the case of inhomogeneous materials. Thus, it is necessary to repeat the measurements at many different points of the target surface and average the results of the single analyses. Note, this does not mean averaging the spectra and analysing quantitatively the average spectrum because the changes in the target matrix and the variations of the experimental conditions that may occur from point to point should be treated and compensated on each single spectrum, before averaging the compositional results.',\n",
       "  'The analytical performance of LIBS will certainly benefit from the continuing improvement of machine-learning algorithms, which are now becoming essential for analysis of large sets of data. These algorithms enable the reduction of the volume of data to be processed through the selection of the most important spectral features in the LIBS dataset, offering greater speed and efficiency compared with conventional statistical methods. Additionally, they enable the development of analytical models that correlate these spectral features with the chemical composition of the samples. When correctly employed and verified, machine-learning algorithms can produce outstanding results in classification and quantitative analysis by LIBS (see, for example, refs.73,195). The use of machine learning is not, however, the solution to all LIBS analytical issues. Improving the quality of LIBS data is still the categorical imperative for widening consensus on the use of LIBS in laboratory analytical applications. An example of how to establish ‘best practice’ for LIBS are the so-called proficiency tests, the most recent of which were organized by the LIBS community in France166and then by the LIBS group in Brno, Czech Republic, for the classification195and quantification73of complex materials. These tests have demonstrated the analytical potential of LIBS when the chemometric algorithms are supported and validated by thorough physical and chemical considerations.',\n",
       "  'Even greater attention must be given to the validation of results for applications in which the LIBS technique is pushed beyond its intrinsic limitations and characteristics. An example is the classification of materials that have very similar atomic composition but different structure. As LIBS is an elemental technique, variations in the LIBS spectrum that discriminate one sample from another could only be due to a physical matrix effect, which produces a change in the plasma parameters (ablated mass, electron temperature and number density). Although this might work in the controlled conditions of a laboratory experiment, in real applications many physical, chemical and structural characteristics of the targets can contribute to the observed changes in the plasma parameters and, consequently, in the LIBS spectra, resulting in misleading conclusions about the samples under analysis. In fact, this example should be taken as a strong warning against proposing applications of LIBS that exceed the intrinsic capability of the technique196; much of the current prejudice against LIBS probably arises from the failure to keep exaggerated promises made for important applications.',\n",

In the LIBS community, there is a tendency to consider the technique as a kind of ‘Swiss Army knife’ — a good-for-all tool, capable of doing everything. However, future developments of LIBS as an analytical technique will probably be directed towards a few key applications where it could really make a difference. Besides some niche industrial applications, probably the most mature application of LIBS relies on its capability of producing 2D and 3D high-resolution elemental images. Excellent results have been obtained on geological targets117,132, and on biological targets197— in this important work, the researchers obtained a time series of high-resolution (larger than a megapixel) LIBS elemental maps illustrating the accumulation of injected gadolinium nanoparticles in a mouse kidney, and acquiring precious information on the regions in the kidney more sensitive to the accumulation of nanoparticles.

       " 'paper_33.html': ['Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are the leading cause of premature mortality, imposing a substantial burden on population health and socio-economic well-being. The widespread impact of CVD on populations, coupled with the complexity of management, underscores the growing burden on healthcare systems and patients1,2,3. Moreover, drug-induced cardiotoxicity is a significant factor that restricts the development and utilization of new drugs. Many drugs are precluded from clinical application or recalled post-marketing due to adverse cardiac effects. More seriously, drug-induced cardiotoxicity can lead to cardiovascular complications, and in severe cases, may even result in sudden death4,5,6,7. Less than 30% of the compounds tested in U.S. clinical trials successfully reach commercial availability due to drug-induced cardiotoxicity, which leads to a cycle of wasted time, increased expenses, and resource depletion, highlighting the urgent need for accelerated research into all facets of cardiovascular effects8. Electrocardiography, echocardiography, and coronary computed tomography angiography stand as the primary methods to evaluate cardiovascular morphology9,10,11,12. While providing insights into cardiac function, these diagnostic tools are constrained by the low spatial resolution13. To overcome these challenges, cardiomyocyte-based models and sensing technologies are proposed as promising alternatives14,15,16. Establishing a robust cardiomyocyte-based platform is crucial for comprehensive CVD investigation and early anticipation of drug-related cardiotoxicity17.',\n",
       "  'Electrophysiological sensing of cardiomyocytes is a commonly used and important method for characterizing cell status. Electrophysiological methods are widely recognized for their utility in both characterizing and modulating the behaviors of electrogenic cells18,19. Upon the occurrence of hereditary or acquired CVDs, the generation and propagation of action potentials (AP) are altered due to changes in the expression, distribution, and characteristics of myocardial ion channels20. Thus, evaluating electrophysiological dysfunction at the cell level is crucial to understanding organ dysfunction caused by molecular aberrations21. For electrophysiological evaluation, patch clamp is the gold standard for precise, high-fidelity transmembrane potential measurements, offering detailed, high-resolution insights into ion channel properties, which is labor-intensive and low-throughput22. Automated systems increase efficiency but often require isolated cells, which can disrupt cardiomyocyte electrical coupling and affect measurement accuracy23,24. Extracellular electrodes like planar microelectrode arrays (MEAs) enable noninvasive and easy recording of extracellular APs but cannot capture transmembrane potentials, limiting their ability to reflect detailed arrhythmic features18,25. Alternatively, intracellular recordings from three-dimensional (3D) nanoelectrode arrays (NEAs) can accurately measure AP duration, refractory period, and upstroke velocity, providing precise parameters for electrophysiological properties of cardiomyocytes26,27,28. Therefore, NEAs emerge as highly promising tools in the field of cardiovascular research.',\n",
       "  'Specifically, there exist two major categories of 3D nanodevices: active and passive. As detailed in Table1, active devices can actively control or modify electrical signals, and offer capabilities such as amplification, signal fidelity, dynamic modulation, and real-time processing, making them suitable for applications that demand high resolution and precision, particularly in electrophysiology and biomedical sensing. However, active NEAs require an external power source to operate. Passive devices, however, are characterized by their simple structure and independence of an external power source, which facilitates easier and more cost-effective design and manufacturing29. Furthermore, passive devices often exhibit high biocompatibility, generating minimal heat and causing less impact on biological tissues30. Their simplicity also increases stability and durability, with minimal susceptibility to external interference. Additionally, passive devices have low power consumption, making them ideal for miniaturized or implantable applications31. Due to the straightforward design and reduced complexity, passive devices are especially suited for large-scale applications requiring mass production32. Thus, passive devices are widely used for electrophysiological sensing, particularly where active control is not necessary. Despite the aforementioned advantages, the design and 3D structure of the passive devices are crucial for the quality of intracellular signal acquisition.',\n",

The vertical geometry of NEAs is crucial for strengthening signal detection34. The tight envelopment of the cell membrane around vertical electrodes reduces the separation between the cell membrane and electrode, thereby boosting seal resistance35,36,37. Moreover, for bioelectronic devices to achieve a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and amplitude comparable to those in patch clamp, establishing direct contact between recording elements and targeted intracellular locations is necessary while minimizing interference with cell membranes38. To meet these criteria, it is essential to thoroughly understand the size, shape, mechanical properties, and biochemical interactions at the interface between the cell membrane and the nanodevice39. Manufacturing techniques significantly influence nanodevice size, geometry, and the interaction of NEAs with cell membranes. Advances in nanoelectrode technology, particularly through the integration of Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS) technology, have significantly enhanced the ability to record and modulate cellular electrical activity on a large scale40. Furthermore, by enabling parallel recordings from individual cells and networks, these innovations improve the precision and scalability of electrophysiological studies.',\n",

Figure2depicts various representative configurations of electrodes as well as the interface between 3D electrodes and cells. To improve coupling between external electrodes and nerve cells by mimicking the neuronal environment, Spira et al. developed gold mushroom-shaped microelectrodes (gMμEs), which typically comprise a stalk, a base, and a cap (Fig.2a)47,48,49. The fabrication of gMμEs begins by coating silicon or glass samples with a Cr/Au layer using sputtering. Then, samples are spin-coated with photoresistant material. Photolithography, utilizing a photomask, can create openings in the photoresistor. gMμEs are subsequently formed on the surface through gold deposition, before removing the photoresistor layer. The quality of the pattern layer and the stalk thickness are determined by lithography parameters, while the mushroom head size depends on deposition conditions. gMμEs are effective for long-term detection of intracellular APs with improved endocytosis when coated with laminin, allowing for 2–10\\u2009min recordings under short electroporation pulses47. However, gMμEs have limitations. One issue is that the success of endocytosis can vary depending on where the cell is located. This variability affects the deformation of the membrane and the quality of the recordings. Additionally, high resistance at the junction between the membrane and electrode can lead to signal loss, which reduces the quality of detection. Solutions to these issues include fabricating a fence structure around the gMμEs to stabilize cell positioning and using low-impedance materials to reduce resistance and improve overall performance48,49. Recent research has demonstrated that vertically aligned nanopillar electrodes can establish strong interactions with cell membranes, significantly reducing impedance by several orders of magnitude through localized electroporation44,50,51,52,53. Nanopillar electrode fabrication involves photolithography for defining Pt tracks and contact pads on quartz substrates, followed by SiO2deposition via chemical vapor deposition (CVD) under low-pressure conditions for insulation. Reactive ion etching and electron beam lithography create nanoholes above each Pt pad until the Pt layer. Next, Pt nanopillars can be deposited into the nanoholes using a focused ion beam (FIB). Finally, the devices are treated with oxygen plasma for cleaning before coating with a diluted Matrigel matrix and cell plating43. However, nanopillar electrode arrays can also be fabricated through a templated process including atomic layer deposition (ALD), etching, lithography, deposition, and liftoff. The electrodes feature a polyethylene terephthalate (PET) substrate with an Al2O3core and a Ti/Au conductive coating, insulated with a negative photoresistor layer(Fig.2b)51. Although nanopillar electrodes offer minimally invasive intracellular recording and are easily scalable, they can suffer from signal loss due to the gap between membrane and electrode. On the other hand, nanowires are ideal as intracellular probes due to their small size, which allows for minimally invasive insertion, while their solid-state nature prevents cell leakage40,54,55,56. Another process involves the fabrication of nanowire electrodes by plasma enhanced CVD (PECVD) for SiO2layer deposition, stepper lithography, and dry etching to define SiO2pillars, followed by wet etching to create the nanoelectrode core (Fig.2c)40. Then, Ti and Pt are sputtered onto the pillars, before adding an ALD passivation layer. A resistor protects the base during wet etching, leaving the metal tip exposed for electrical interrogation. The latest vertical ultrasharp nanowires feature increased height, with tip diameters as small as 10\\u2009nm, enabling better cell penetration57. In other cases, iridium oxide (IrOx) nanotubes have been fabricated by cutting a quartz wafer into small pieces, followed by photolithography, Pt/Ti deposition, and liftoff to produce a pattern of electrode pads and lead lines58. The substrate is then coated with Si3N4and SiO2layers via PECVD. Plasma etching then exposes the Pt contact pads, and electron beam lithography defines nanoholes on a resist-coated chip. Then, the underlying Si3N4/SiO2layers are removed to expose the Pt layer, and IrOx nanotubes are electrodeposited into the nanoholes using the resistor as a template (Fig.2d). The advance of nanotube electrodes leverages cells’ natural propensity to interact with their environment59. In contrast to vertical nanopillar electrodes, the membrane protrusions within nanotube electrodes enhance local membrane tension and reduce the gap between the membrane and electrode60,61. Additionally, ion flows from ion channels or openings within the internal nanotube membrane are more readily detectable before dissipating into the surrounding medium. However, intracellular recordings using IrOx nanotube electrodes suffer from poor SNR and diminished signal amplitude, so addressing these issues is essential for achieving signal quality comparable to that of glass micropipettes and patch clamps60. Similarly, the fabrication of volcanic nanopatterned electrodes begins with successive evaporations of Ti, Pt, Ti, Au, and Ti layers onto a glass wafer, followed by SiO2sputtering42,62. The substrate is then spin-coated with a photoresistor layer, patterned with 2-μm-diameter openings using a direct laser writer, and Ar+ion beam etching, followed by photoresistor stripping with O2plasma42. Electrically conductive tracks are then patterned on a new photoresistor layer, reflowed, placed at an angle, and stripped with O2plasma. Finally, an insulating SU8 layer is spin-coated to complete electrode fabrication (Fig.2e). Compared with other nanoelectrodes, nanovolcano (NV) electrodes, with a high aspect ratio and sharp design, offer improved cell access without reducing the effective recording area, leading to lower impedance and higher SNR. Recently, NV electrodes with a large 3D Pt electrode and an insulating SiO2layer have been developed for stable intracellular recordings lasting >60\\u2009min42. Although functionalized gold nanoring was considered critical for sealing, later studies highlighted that tip geometry is more crucial for ensuring a secure cell-electrode interface62. Further research suggests optimizing the shape, size, and materials of NV electrodes, or integrating them with CMOS amplifiers, to enhance recording quality and duration63. Nanocrown electrodes (Fig.2f) are partially hollow structures featuring an uneven crown edge28,64. The fabrication involves patterning Cr disks via photolithography and using reactive ion etching to form quartz nanostructures64. Ti and Pt are then deposited for metal connections, followed by Si3N4and SiO2insulation layers. Afterward, a wet etch reveals the nanoelectrode tips and further etching creates nanocrown structures, completing the fabrication. The nanocrown’s shape has been shown to promote cell membrane wrapping around its surface, improving cell adherence to its core64. This design allows for approximately 60\\u2009min of intracellular access to human pluripotent stem cells-derived cardiomyocytes (hPSC-CMs). Additionally, nanocrowns at a depth of 180\\u2009nm could record intracellular signals with twice the amplitude compared to those at a depth of 450\\u2009nm64.',\n",

       "  'Recent advancements in nanoelectrode technology have focused on overcoming the inherent challenges related to the complexity and high costs of conventional manufacturing processes65. A notable innovation was the development of nanobranched electrode arrays, fabricated using a combination of hydrothermal growth and micromachining66. These electrodes are characterized by dense nanobranches with a high aspect ratio, where each electrode measures 20\\u2009×\\u200920\\u2009μm2. The individual branches have a tip diameter of approximately 200\\u2009nm and a root diameter of around 100\\u2009nm. This unique configuration enhances the interface between electrode and cell, significantly improving intracellular signal recording. In experimental studies, these nanobranched electrodes successfully recorded intracellular signals from cardiomyocytes for up to 105\\u2009min, demonstrating effectiveness in long-term cell recordings66. This capability makes nanobranched electrodes highly valuable for extended electrophysiological studies.',\n",
       "  'Another significant advancement was the fabrication of nanotrap matrix electrodes from porous PET membranes using microfabrication lithography and magnetron sputtering67. These nanotrap electrodes incorporate traps of varying sizes and densities, strategically designed to promote a tight seal between the cell membrane and the electrode. This tight seal enables self-protruding electroporation, improving the quality and stability of intracellular recordings. This design can extend recording times to approximately 100\\u2009min, further demonstrating the efficacy of advanced electrode configurations67.',\n",
       "  'In addition to these advanced designs, supramolecular self-assembly electrodes have emerged as a promising way to simplify fabrication and reduce the associated costs68. Unlike traditional 3D micro/nanoelectrodes that require complex micro/nano fabrication or solvothermal synthesis, supramolecular self-assembly relies on small organic molecules that efficiently self-assemble into various 3D nanostructures, such as lamellated nanosheets, thin nanobelts, and rod-like structures68. These structures significantly enhance the cell-electrode interface, increasing quality and prolonging intracellular recordings compared to conventional electrodes. The simpler, cost-effective fabrication process makes these electrodes particularly suitable for large-scale electrophysiological studies. Furthermore, the exploration of additional geometrical designs, such as nanorods, offers potential pathways for further enhancing intracellular recording technologies, ultimately paving the way for more accessible and scalable bioelectronic devices65,69,70.',\n",
       "  'Advanced materials such as graphene, MoS2, and conductive polymers exhibit exceptional biocompatibility, mainly due to their low cytotoxicity, high surface area, and flexibility, which facilitate efficient interaction and integration with cells71,72. These materials promote cell adhesion and growth while minimizing inflammatory responses, ensuring the long-term stability and functionality of the NEAs. Additionally, surface functionalization with bioactive coatings can further enhance cellular interactions by creating a more favorable microenvironment for cell attachment73. This functionalization makes NEAs ideal for chronic applications in electrophysiology and disease modeling, where sustained compatibility with living cells is crucial.',\n",
       "  'To achieve high-fidelity intracellular signals, the nanodevice probe must penetrate the plasma membrane and establish strong coupling to the membrane. Effective intracellular access should enable high-quality, long-term signal recording while preserving cell viability38,39. Intracellular access methods are broadly categorized into electrode surface modification and physical perforation techniques74. Electrode surface modification, including the use of phospholipids or hydrophobic monolayers, enhances cell adhesion and promotes spontaneous membrane penetration75. In contrast, physical perforation techniques, such as optoporation and electroporation, provide a controlled and precise approach by opening transient pores in the cell membrane.',\n",
       "  'Spontaneous penetration, driven by chemical processes such as endocytosis and adhesion, occurs naturally with minimal impact on cell viability, allowing cells to securely and intimately adhere to the electrode surface76,77. During this process, the lipid bilayer of the cell membrane undergoes a structural rearrangement, forming a tight and robust seal at the penetration site essential for stable intracellular recordings over time. Surface modifications, such as the application of phospholipids or hydrophobic self-assembled monolayers can further optimize this interaction78,79,80. These modifications are specifically designed to enhance the formation of high-resistance membrane seals, thereby improving electrode-cell coupling and promoting more consistent, higher-quality intracellular recordings. Additionally, the precise engineering of these surface coatings improves control over the spontaneous penetration of the electrodes into cells, further reducing signal variability and enhancing the stability and duration of the recorded intracellular signals42.',\n",

Although this spontaneous fusion significantly enhances recording duration, key challenges such as the complexity and labor-intensive nature of the modification procedures can make scaling up difficult81,82. Additionally, inefficiencies in consistently achieving reliable intracellular access further complicate the use of such electrodes. Spontaneous perforations, while beneficial, are often infrequent and short-lived, leading to difficulties in maintaining consistent and stable recordings83. These limitations highlight the need for further optimization of the electrode surface to improve both effectiveness and durability. Addressing these challenges is essential not only for enhancing the reliability of intracellular recordings but also for expanding their application potential to large-scale studies and broader research settings38.',\n",

       "  'Physical perforation methods like optoporation offer significant advantages over chemically induced techniques, particularly in terms of precision and reduced cellular disruption84,85. Optoporation utilizes a focused laser pulse targeted at the electrode-cell interface, inducing various effects such as hot electron injection, thermal heating, and even bubble explosions, all of which facilitate the opening of transient pores in the cell membrane86,87,88. These methods, including plasmonic optoporation and optoacoustic poration, are designed to minimize disturbances to normal cellular activities, thereby supporting stable, long-term intracellular recordings. For instance, Dipalo et al. employed plasmonic optoporation together with vertical nanoelectrodes to generate transient nanopores, allowing uninterrupted intracellular recordings for up to 80\\u2009min (Fig.3b)84. In another example, photoacoustic perforation by mechanical waves from optical pulses together with 3D fuzzy graphene electrodes allowed successful recording of intracellular electrical activity for 20\\u2009min85. Both techniques demonstrate a more controlled, less invasive approach to intracellular access, enhancing recording quality and duration without significantly compromising cell viability. As such, optoporation methods show great promise in the development of reliable, long-term intracellular recording platforms, contributing to advanced electrophysiological research and related applications89. However, achieving high-throughput parallel regulation using optoporation methods remains challenging. Integrating a 3D moving platform under the microscope provides a viable solution for enabling multisite optoporation, facilitating precise, high-throughput control of cells.',\n",
       "  'Electroporation, a widely used technique for intracellular recordings, involves applying electrical pulses to the cellular membrane, creating transient and localized pores that enable extracellular electrodes to capture APs90. Bio-membrane perforation in response to electrical stimuli was first documented in 1972; since then, electroporation has been a leading method in nanoelectrode research due to its simplicity, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness45,91. Electroporation is particularly valued for its ability to achieve intracellular access with minimal complexity. For instance, applying biphasic electrical pulses to HL-1 cardiac muscle cells cultured on nanopillar electrodes enables 10\\u2009min intracellular AP recordings (Fig.3c)44. In a more refined approach, Jahed et al. developed a hollow-nanocrown electrode, which not only enhanced electroporation but also achieved a remarkable 99% success rate, significantly extending both the duration and amplitude of intracellular recordings64. Building on this progress, Fang et al. employed a scalable electroporation strategy using hollow nanopillar electrodes, extending intracellular AP recording durations to 100\\u2009min70. In addition, the concurrent recording of both intracellular and extracellular APs using 3D NEAs via electroporation has gained considerable attention. For example, Hu et al. successfully recorded intracellular and extracellular signals from neonatal rat cardiomyocytes using 3D nanobranched electrodes66. While electroporation substantially enhances the amplitude and quality of intracellular signals, it has some limitations. The process may temporarily disrupt the cell’s electrophysiological functions and the duration of intracellular access is constrained by the cell membrane’s natural repair mechanisms, which try to quickly reseal the transient pores created during the procedure62,92,93. Despite these challenges, electroporation remains a powerful tool in electrophysiological research, continuously contributing to the development of more effective recording technologies.',\n",
       "  'Arrhythmias are closely associated with AP function in cardiomyocytes, having a key role in maintaining the heart’s rhythmic contractions94,95. Proper AP generation and propagation depend on the precise regulation of cardiac ion channels; any disruption in this regulation can result in abnormal heart rhythm or arrhythmia96. Thus, a deep understanding of cardiomyocyte APs is essential for both pharmacological testing and disease modeling, as it allows researchers to study how different drugs or genetic conditions might affect cardiac function. Traditional extracellular recordings, while useful, tend to produce low-resolution signals that fail to capture the full complexity of the waveform, often lacking key information on ion channel dynamics69,97. In contrast, intracellular AP recordings from 3D electrodes offer much more detailed data, providing critical insights into the resting membrane potential and specific ion channel activity98,99,100. Thus, passive 3D nanoelectrodes are particularly valuable in advanced cardiology research, enabling higher-resolution recordings crucial for accurately assessing cardiomyocyte function and investigating the underlying mechanisms of arrhythmias (Table2).',\n",

Drug-induced cardiotoxicity can be acute and/or chronic, posing considerable challenges to long-term patient safety and requiring more reliable and efficient cardiotoxicity evaluation methods102,104. As a result, interest in the use of NEA platforms for in vitro drug screening has risen, as these platforms enable the detection of subtle changes in cardiomyocyte APs and ion channel activity in response to drug exposure (Fig.4)18,98,105,106,107.',\n",

For instance, Xie et al. utilized nanopillar electrode arrays to investigate the effects of nifedipine, a calcium channel blocker, and tetraethylammonium (TEA), a potassium channel blocker, on APs in HL-1 cells44. A concentration of 100\\u2009nM nifedipine caused a significant reduction in APD50 and extended the refractory period, whereas 10\\u2009mM TEA had the opposite effect (Fig.4a). Further, Abbott et al. developed a CMOS-NEA biosensing platform with 1024 channels allowing for extensive and high-resolution intracellular recordings40. After perfusing cells with ATX-II for 239\\u2009s, they observed a uniform increase in AP duration across a cellular sheet, with notable regional differences in the extent of APD prolongation (Fig.4b).

Human-induced pluripotent stem cells were treated with 500\\u2009nM dofetilide, 50\\u2009μM tetrodotoxin (TTX), and 50\\u2009nM ATX-II, which revealed distinct cellular responses, such as slower repolarization (dofetilide), prolonged depolarization (TTX), and altered cellular shapes (ATX-II; Fig.4c). Moreover, nanocrown electrode arrays demonstrated exceptional sensitivity to subtle drug-induced changes in cardiac electrophysiology, due to fast-sampling rates and self-referential comparison capabilities64. Jahed et al. developed a 57-electrode nanocrown array, which successfully differentiated drug responses, showing that high-risk drugs like dofetilide (0.3\\u2009nM, 1\\u2009nM, 3\\u2009nM, 10\\u2009nM) and D,L-Sotalol (0.1\\u2009µM, 1\\u2009µM, 10\\u2009µM, 100\\u2009µM) cause a dose-dependent increase in AP duration, while lower-risk drugs such as verapamil (1\\u2009nM, 10\\u2009nM, 100\\u2009nM, 1000\\u2009nM) and nifedipine (1\\u2009nM, 10\\u2009nM, 100\\u2009nM, 1000\\u2009nM) decreased AP duration (Fig.4d)64.

The system enabled the simultaneous recording of intracellular APs using nanopillar electrodes together with a conventional patch clamp, providing a more comprehensive view of the cells’ electrical activity. The platform was particularly effective in modeling hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, as it accurately captured arrhythmic activity and delayed depolarization patterns, in contrast to the regular beat intervals observed in healthy cardiomyocytes43. Moreover, the platform successfully demonstrated the prolonged APs characteristic of long QT syndrome, further validating its utility in disease-specific research43. In another study, Liu et al. designed a heart-on-a-chip model to investigate the effects of acute hypoxia on cardiac performance114.

These advanced devices hold tremendous potential for more precise and high-resolution insights into cardiac activity, helping to uncover new therapeutic approaches for heart diseases. However, several challenges must be addressed to fully realize the promise of passive 3D NEAs. First, further optimizing the design and penetration techniques of passive NEAs is critical for achieving efficient interfacing with cardiomyocytes35,108,120. Electroporation faces challenges such as membrane disruption, inconsistent permeabilization, and noise interference during intracellular recordings41. Single-pulse electroporation is considered a less invasive method for the study of cardiomyocytes; however, precise regulation of parameters such as pulse amplitude and duration is critical for enhancing recording fidelity64,121. Advancing single-pulse techniques and integrating advanced noise-reduction strategies are vital for achieving stable, safe, and high-quality intracellular recordings. Second, integration of NEAs with CMOS technology, which has the potential to enable high-throughput, high-resolution intracellular recordings at a large scale122,123,124. CMOS integration significantly improves spatial resolution by minimizing the number of leads at the electrode layer, achieved through shared leads, allowing for thousands of electrodes to be integrated. Leveraging addressable capabilities, these passive NEAs enable recordings at both the single cells and their networks, allowing for precise cell modulation and the detailed mapping of electrical activity propagation within the cells40. Furthermore, combining passive NEAs with CMOS technology boosts scalability by enabling high-density electrode integration, parallel data processing, miniaturization, and cost-effective production, making the system suitable for large-scale applications125. However, while CMOS integration enhances functionality, new technical challenges arise, such as the need for innovative solutions to maintain signal fidelity, manage heat dissipation, and ensure seamless integration of the two technologies123,125,126. Consequently, material selection and structural precision remain critical factors127,128,129. Ongoing research focuses on refining manufacturing methods and material properties to improve the overall performance of these devices38. Compared to traditional inorganic electrodes, new soft and functionalized materials offer significant potential for enhancing the biocompatibility of NEAs. To effectively incorporate these promising biocompatible materials into passive 3D NEAs, developing optimized fabrication techniques that suit their unique properties is essential. Conventional fabrication methods often lack compatibility with soft materials, necessitating the development of innovative dry patterning, low-temperature deposition, and plasma-free processes that are compatible with novel materials130. Certain 2D materials are prone to oxidation in biochemical environments, necessitating the development of surface passivation techniques that not only maintain electrical conductivity but also provide effective insulation against water and oxygen. These advancements would not only improve biocompatibility but also enhance the long-term stability of the devices. Furthermore, future developments in multiparameter detection aim to revolutionize the use of 3D nanoelectrodes, particularly for drug toxicity assessments69,100,131. By enabling simultaneous monitoring of multiple biological parameters, the reliability and effectiveness of the drug screening platforms could be significantly enhanced99,132,133,134. The use of organoids will further strengthen these drug testing systems, providing a more accurate representation of how drugs interact with human tissues135,136,137,138. Beyond drug screening, integrating bioelectronic devices with electrical stimulation technologies offers promising new treatments for cardiac conditions such as arrhythmias139.

       " 'paper_34.html': ['Multiphoton 3D lithography (MP3DL) is an advanced additive manufacturing technique used to create complex 3D microstructures or nanostructures. This method leverages the non-linear optical phenomenon of multiphoton absorption (MPA) (most commonly two-photon absorption (2PA)) to initiate a localized chemical reaction in aphotosensitive resin/photoresist. MP3DL is highly flexible, similar totrue 3D printing, but unlike that process can be used with a wide spectrum of materials and create sub-100\\u2009nm spatial features. These advantages have meant that MP3DL has been instrumental in fields requiring micro-scale and nano-scale fabrication, such as nanophotonics, microfluidics, micro-optics, micromechanics, nanomechanics and tissue engineering. The technique has been used for industrial processes, including mass-customized manufacturing and the production of high-definition templates, micro-optics and photonic integrated chips1,2,3.',\n",
       "  'MP3DL was introduced in 1997 and dramatic enhancements of the technology have been made since then. The technique was first established as a submicrometre 3D structuring tool for polymerizable materials4and attracted immediate attention in the fields of optics, fluidics, mechanics, medicine and material sciences. Progress in laser 3D lithography has paralleled that in microscopy, and has seen the introduction of multiphoton, stimulated emission depletion (STED), structured light and light sheet techniques5. Current MP3DL techniques now allow for deep sub-wavelength feature size and parallel structuring, the processing of inorganic materials and multi-material printing. Further advances include dynamic resolution and throughput adjustment on the fly and the ability to tune the degree of photomodification, opening up 4D printing options6. MP3DL is providing benefits for physics, chemistry, biology and medical fields by exploiting the latest advances in laser engineering, beam shaping, materials and deep learning. The technique allows the realization of arbitrary architectures and printing on virtually any substrate, whether a flat substrate, the tip of an optical fibre, a microfluidic channel, a preassembled sensor or a chip7.',\n",
       "  'The key scientific principle behind MP3DL is MPA — a process where two or more photons are absorbed simultaneously by a molecule or an atom8. This is a non-linear optical process, meaning the absorption rate depends on the square (or higher powers) of the light intensity, allowing for highly localized energy deposition9. MPA is followed by a chemical reaction that changes the solubility of the excited material at the focal point of the laser beam.Positive tone materialssuch as PMMA, AZ resists and S1800 series materials increase in solubility in the exposed volumes, leading to the removal of written parts10, whereasnegative tone materialsdecrease in solubility in the exposed volumes, in most cases through a chemical cross-linking (polymerization) reaction11, and the written parts remain after development. Negative tone materials are most commonly used for MP3DL and include metals and cross-linkable proteins12,13. A serial direct laser writing (DLW) system is employed in MP3DL, where a focused laser beam is moved through a photosensitive material to induce a localized chemical change. DLW in the context of MP3DL refers specifically to using MPA to initiate this selective photomodification14. The most common approach in MP3DL is two-photon polymerization, in which two photons are absorbed simultaneously to initiate polymerization. Although MPA is a probabilistic phenomenon, the material reaction is thresholded, meaning that a modification threshold needs to be exceeded in order to form rigid features. The combination of cross-linking and thethreshold behaviourof the material allows for the creation of 3D structures with feature sizes below 100\\u2009nm\\xa0(ref.15). Typically, a femtosecond laser emitting pulses with durations in the femtosecond range (10−15s) is used. Short pulses allow for the high peak intensities necessary for MPA without causing considerable heat damage or optical breakdown to the material. It is crucial that the writing material has non-linear properties; for example, media in which the dielectric polarization responds non-linearly (not proportionally) to the electric field of the light. High numerical aperture (NA) objectives (NA\\u2009>\\u20091) are widely used to focus the laser beam to a small spot size, allowing for high-resolution patterning.Featuresbelow the classicalλ/2 limit can be achieved routinely and resolution (the distance between the individual features) below the diffraction limit can be realized with some additional efforts, such as sophisticated light excitation schemes or specifically tailored materials.',\n",

Other approaches include the use of high-power lasers combined with the high scanning speeds offered by polygonal scanners. Advances in volumetric beam shaping have also contributed to increased throughput, although these have not yet reached the precision and flexibility offered by other forms of DLW.

       "  'Conventional optical or laser lithography is based on one-photon absorption (1PA). In these methods, the wavelength of the exposing laser matches the absorption of thephotoinitiator. An example with the photoinitiator phenyl-bis(2,4,6-trimethylbenzoyl)phosphine oxide (IRG819) and the pre-polymer SZ2080 is demonstrated in Fig.1a. With 1PA, photons are absorbed along the whole path through the photoresist, following Beer’s law; the cross-linking density (for negative tone resists) therefore decreases exponentially with increasing penetration depth. This limits the ability of these techniques to fabricate true 3D structures with feature size close to the diffraction limit. The above limitation is overcome by introducing a non-linearity into the process, either anoptical non-linearityor achemical non-linearity, or even a combination of both, leading to a relatively well-defined threshold behaviour. Optical non-linearity means that instead of absorbing one photon (1PA) the simultaneous absorption of multiple photons (2PA or three-photon absorption (3PA)) is employed, as depicted in Fig.1b. Here, the wavelength of the exciting laser is shifted to a longer wavelength. Generally, a degenerate case is used for 2PA, in which two photons of the same frequency are absorbed; however, photons of different wavelengths (non-degenerate) can be used as well18. Once an atom is in the excited state it will either experience an electron transfer or be further excited and can be ionized by multiphoton ionization (MPI), depending on the applied optical intensity. The excited electron typically undergoes system crossing to the triplet state and from there initiates a cross-linking reaction via radical formation. Alternatively, it can return to the ground state via a radiative pathway, emitting a photon, or through non-radiative decay.',\n",

       "  'Themechanical rigidityof structures depends on the material stiffness, the degree of polymerization and the architecture. The importance of the structural properties of the material to object quality increases as features get smaller and the geometry has higher aspect ratios. The object must not only be precisely exposed but be strong enough to keep its integrity after developing. The better the threshold can be defined, the smaller the features and the higher the resolution that can be realized with this process.',\n",
       "  'Most photoresists optimized for conventional laser lithography can also be used for MP3DL. Monomers such as acrylates and methacrylates are often used as photoresists due to their rapid polymerization. Pre-polymer materials must convert to mechanically robust polymers upon curing. Optimizing monomer blends to balance stiffness and elasticity is critical for achieving a stable structure that resists deformation caused by shrinkage and survives wet chemical development. Photoresists or photoresists that are designed for high-speed fabrication, such as low-viscosity photoresists and those with more reactive and faster-reacting resins, are generally preferred, especially for 3D structures that require fine feature detail.',\n",
       "  'A crucial condition of the photoresist is to have negligible 1PA at the writing laser wavelength, but a sufficient 2PA cross-section to initialize the polymerization. This adds an optical non-linearity into the process and means that two photons have to be simultaneously absorbed to excite the photoinitiator and allow electronic transition into an excited state from which cross-linking is initiated. Photons travelling through the sample are only absorbed if the density of photons is high enough to allow for 2PA. This spatially selective crossing of the threshold at specific positions inside the whole sample volume is the key to allow the fabrication of truly 3D microstructures and nanostructures, and is most commonly achieved by using high NA objectives to focus the beam and ultrashort laser pulses with sub-picosecond pulse durations19. The required intensity to create the conditions for non-linear light–matter interaction is in the range of gigawatts to terawatts per square centimetre9. It is convenient to measure the average optical power experimentally; the square of the electric field (the intensity) governs the light–matter interaction under short pulse exposure6.',\n",
       "  'To determine whether 2PA, 3PA or MPI is occurring in a material, one can study the feature size (for example, line-width) in relation to the intensity used for exposure. A quadratic relationship between laser intensity and feature size indicates 2PA, a cubic relationship suggests 3PA and so on. However, experimental observations often show non-integer exponents, hinting at more complicated light–matter interactions. Orders higher than 2PA are often not technically relevant as they require such high power that small power fluctuations lead to dramatic variations in the effective intensity at the focus, which in turn decides whether the threshold of the material is surpassed or not.',\n",
       "  'Given the threshold behaviour, stable features can reach dimensions well below 100\\u2009nm. However, feature size should not be confused with resolution, which describes the minimum separation that can be realized between two features. A cross-linking density above the threshold is high enough for written features to withstand the development process, whereas the regions below the threshold are also cross-linked but are below the threshold at which structures will survive development. Writing another line close to the first line will increase the overall cross-linking density above the threshold and reduce resolution. For this reason, MP3DL cannot achieve resolutions below the diffraction limit20.',\n",

The voxel shown in Fig.2is an ellipsoidal iso-intensity distribution defined by the threshold intensity, which results in cross-linked regions a few hundred nanometres in size (Fig.2a). The actual dimensions of the cross-linked region depend on the laser intensity (which is determined by the laser average power, pulse repetition rate and pulse width). Whereas the threshold defines the lower boundary of intensity required forphotocrosslinking, the upper boundary is indicated by the optical damage threshold (Fig.2b) above which optical breakdown occurs that can be observed as boiling, bubbling, carbonization, burning or exploding depending on how much the threshold is exceeded and how the specific material responds.

       "  'A well-defined polarization state serves two independent purposes in an MP3DL set-up. First, linear polarization is of importance to control the laser power in the set-up. Second, the linear polarization should be transformed into circular polarization using a quarter-waveplate. This step is important as polarization introduces an asymmetry into the intensity distribution in the focal volume under focusing with high NA objective lenses40,41. This asymmetry leads to different feature sizes along the two orthogonal lateral directions and, thus, to unwanted distortions of the final structures. Circular polarization averages out this asymmetry and ensures feature size is writing direction-independent.',\n",

For both approaches, linear polarization is important. Acousto-optical modulators allow for more rapid modulation of laser power and we advise using this even if it increases the cost of the set-up; as feature size depends on the laser power, changes in writing speed during writing will lead to distortions of the structures and rapidly compensating therefore helps maintain consistent feature sizes and realize high sample quality.',\n",

However, most systems today use a combined approach where the beam is rapidly scanned using a pair of galvanometric mirrors to quickly address any position in the field of view of the objective lens and larger samples are generated by additional movements of the substrate by highly precise translational stages. Although MP3DL allows for full 3D trajectories to be written, the combination of two fast lateral axes is well suited for a layer-by-layer writing strategy.',\n",

Using a high NA lens to obtain fine features (for example, 100\\u2009×\\u20091.4 NA), the writing field with galvanometric scanners reaches sidelengths of several hundred micrometres. Axial movement is usually achieved through a combination of an ultra-precise piezo drive with a conventional mechanical translational stage to allow for sample heights reaching several millimetres. For most efficient use of the galvanometric mirrors, it has to be ensured that mirrors are imaged onto the entrance pupil of the objective lens43.',\n",

In this way, the total movement of the stages can be several tens of centimetres with an accuracy reaching a few hundred nanometres.

Another solution to stitching is to synchronize the movement of linear motion stages and galvanometric scanners for continuous 3D writing. This latter mode is called the infinite field of view.

       "  'It is important to minimize aberrations to achieve the highest possible resolution and structural definition. Aberrations are mainly introduced by refractive index differences between the objective lens, the immersion medium and the photoresist. This introduces a defocus, which is linearly proportional to the writing depth and can thus be compensated by appropriate scaling of the movement of the axial stage. Much more difficult to control are spherical aberrations, which lead to a deformation of the voxel with writing depth. This deformation leads to a varying shape of the iso-intensity surface defining the threshold and thus to heterogeneities in the structure. Most importantly, it reduces peak intensity inside the voxel, which reduces the threshold so that structures cannot be written at all when surpassing a certain writing depth48.',\n",
       "  'Several solutions have been found to compensate for aberrations. See Fig.4for an overview of common printing configurations. If the refractive indices of all the materials cannot be perfectly matched, the introduced aberrations can be made to stay constant throughout the sample volume by maintaining the propagation distance through the different materials. This can be done using the so-called dip-in configuration49(Fig.4b), where the objective lens is in direct contact with the photoresist, which also acts as the immersion medium. The substrate is positioned at the focal spot and subsequently moved away from the objective, while the structure is fabricated in a layer-by-layer writing process. Here, only a single interface between the objective lens and the photoresist can introduce aberrations, which are then constant during the writing process. If direct contact between the objective lens and the photoresist is not desired, the objective can be wrapped in transparent foil50or an alternative approach is to use a vat of substrate that is illuminated from below (Fig.4b). In the vat system, light travels from the objective lens through a droplet of immersion medium and the bottom of the vat before it hits the photoresist, and the travelling distance of light to the writing spot is kept constant. The substrate is dipped into the photoresist in the vat and then subsequently moved out of the vat while the sample is fabricated in a layer-by-layer fashion.',\n",
       "  'The approaches described above require a liquid photoresist. Liquid photoresists of high viscosity are challenging to use with the vat system as the photoresist has to flow into the small space between the substrate and the bottom of the vat. This becomes increasingly difficult with increasing substrate size. Much more material is needed for the vat mode, as the whole vat needs to be filled with photoresist, whereas for the dip-in mode it is sufficient to fill the small volume between the objective lens and the substrate. Despite these issues, the vat mode can be successfully implemented for ultra-tall aspect-ratio structures, reaching millimetres in height51.',\n",
       "  'Solid photoresists, such as the common negative tone photoresists SU-8 and SZ2080 or the positive tone photoresist AZ9060, cannot be used with the above techniques. Solid photoresists must be prepared on the substrate first and the laser light sent through immersion liquid between the objective lens and the substrate (Fig.4b). Depth-dependent aberrations can only be prevented if the refractive index perfectly matches the immersion system. However, one advantage of a solid photoresist is that it is possible to form a 3D structure following arbitrary trajectories without building the structure in a layer-by-layer fashion. If the photoresist changes in refractive index after exposure, structuring samples in a layer-by-layer fashion might still be advantageous to avoid guiding the laser beam through already exposed structures.',\n",
       "  'Having mounted the substrate in one of the three described ways above, the interface between the photoresist and the substrate must be found to then anchor the structure onto the substrate. In the dip-in and vat modes, the substrate is not passed by the illuminating laser beam and the substrate might therefore have a refractive index that differs slightly from the immersion system; thus, the interface can be found by observing the reflection of the writing laser or, even better, another laser with low intensity and a wavelength that is well separated from any absorption band of the photoresist to avoid accidental exposure. Measuring at three (or ideally more) different spots can determine a tilt or curvature of the substrate and compensate for it. Without a difference in the refractive index of the substrate and photoresist, the photoluminescence of the photoinitiator can be used to find the interface instead as the photoluminescence will vanish if the exciting laser is focused inside the substrate.',\n",
       "  'In MP3DL, meticulous sample preparation and handling are essential for achieving high-resolution and defect-free structures. Initially, an adhesion promoter, typically a silane-based compound, can be applied to the substrate to enhance the attachment of the photoresist, ensuring stability and precision during the writing process52,53. This process begins with cleaning the substrate using techniques such as ultrasonic cleaning, plasma cleaning or solvents (acids, bases solutions, alcohols, ketones), followed by rinsing to remove any contaminants, dust or organic residues that might interfere with adhesion. Once the substrate is clean, the adhesion promoter is applied by spin-coating, dipping or vapour deposition, depending on the nature of the substrate and the type of promoter used54. The adhesion promoter forms a self-assembled molecular monolayer on the substrate surface, creating a strong chemical bond with the photoresist layer. This enhances its adherence and prevents delamination during subsequent processing steps such as development and drying. This step is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the intricate patterns being formed and greatly improves the uniformity and reliability of the photoresist coating or drop adding, especially on substrates with challenging topographies or inherently poor adhesion properties (Fig.4a).',\n",

For a positive photoresist, the exposed areas become soluble in the developer, whereas for a negative photoresist, the unexposed areas are dissolved away55. The choice of the specific developer (or their mixture) and development time is crucial, as these directly affect the resolution and fidelity of the final structure.',\n",
       "  'After development, the sample is thoroughly rinsed to remove any remaining developer solution and then dried. Drying is critical, and improper drying can lead to defects such as structure collapse or deformation due to surface tension effects. A technique know as critical point drying (CPD) is used to avoid the above issues; in CPD, the liquid in the developed photoresist is replaced with gas, thus minimizing surface tension effects. The sample is first immersed in a transitional fluid (for example, ethanol or isopropanol) and later is replaced with liquid carbon dioxide, which can be converted to gas through achieving a supercritical state. The sample is then gradually heated and pressurized until the fluid reaches its critical point, where the liquid and gas phases become indistinguishable. By carefully venting the chamber, the supercritical fluid is replaced by gas, allowing the sample to dry without the surface tension forces that would otherwise damage delicate structures56.',\n",

Today, most devices offer the possibility to import greyscale images (for example, in JPEG file format) as a template, where the intensity of the image is translated to the height of the sample, or to import structures directly from 3D CAD tools using theSTLfile format. The STL format describes solid 3D objects using triangles to describe surface geometry and the inside and outside surfaces are determined depending on the direction of the vertices of the triangles. The software of the MP3DL device derives the writing path from the STL file by intersecting a plane at a given height with all the lines of the triangles through a process called slicing. The surfaces defined along these lines are then filled with closely spaced lines to create a solid structure through a process called hatching. Slicing and hatching distances are important parameters defining the final structural quality and must be chosen depending on the objective lens, the laser power and the photoresist used45,64,65. State-of-the-art devices come with presets for different materials, which allows for good results without extensive optimization.

Samples with a height of several millimetres — still containing intricate small structural details — are routinely fabricated using the dip-in approach, for example in the field of photonic quantum simulators66or mechanical metamaterials67(Fig.5c).

During exposure, the temperature of the photoresist can change due to the deposited energy and affect, for example, radical diffusion and thus the feature size and resolution of the structure. Radical diffusion depends on both the resin properties (such as viscosity)69as well as the local temperatureT70. The local temperature also contributes to the mobility of oxygen from ambient air and any other radical quenching species71.

MP3DL is a great tool to produce scaffolds for repairing, replacing and enhancing regeneration of the damaged tissues of the body. The scaffolds can offer optimized 3D environments for cell adhesion, culturing, proliferation, migration and differentiation140. The effective stiffness of these scaffolds depends on both the material’s macroscopic stiffness and its architectural features. Architectural elements such as wall thickness, strut density and wall waviness can markedly impact stiffness within these scaffolds. Increased material content within a scaffold leads to thicker walls, which enhance macroscopic stiffness, whereas greater wall waviness at lower material levels reduces it. Beyond macroscopic mechanical properties, the specific arrangement of architectural elements also determines the ‘cell-effective stiffness’ — the actual stiffness experienced by cells at their scale — which is crucial for influencing cellular processes such as differentiation. As cells attach to and migrate within these scaffolds, they respond to the localized stiffness of the structure, which differs from the overall scaffold stiffness due to architectural alignment and structural element interactions. Finite element models used to analyse these interactions reveal that adjusting architectural features can fine-tune the stiffness to optimize cellular responses, suggesting that scaffold design balancing cell-effective stiffness with macroscopic support might better meet the needs of various regenerative applications141.',\n",

Further, layered manufacturing is possible using digital micro-mirror devices188,189,190.

       "  'In contrast to expensive solid-state or fibre-based femtosecond lasers, cheaper and smaller pulsed diode lasers and continuous-wave solid-state lasers are suitable for MP3DL (refs.87,191,192). Structures with 400\\u2009nm periodicity have been performed using ultra-low 1PA (ref.193) and two-step absorption (instead of 2PA) was recently proposed194; in this study, the authors developed a light-sensitive material in which a quadratic dependence of non-linearity was maintained for electron excitation within real energy levels, instead of a virtual one. Using a continuous-wave laser diode was sufficient to obtain structures with 300\\u2009nm periodicity. The technology is being developed further and attempts are being made to achieve high printing speeds using the principles of light sheet microscopy195. A similar way to modify the properties of the material, replacing the virtual level with a real one, was recently suggested using Förster resonance energy transfer196.',\n",
       "  'Improvements in resolution and feature size can be achieved through the application of techniques used in microscopy. Almost spherical voxels can be achieved by implementing 4πmicroscopy; here, the laser beam is split into two equal parts that each have the same optical path. The two separate branches of the beam are then fed into two identical lenses, which are placed opposite each other and focus on the same point. Ideally, a single lens can focus light at an angle of 2πand with two lenses the light is theoretically focused at an angle of 4π. When two coherent beams are brought to one point, their superposition is obtained due to constructive interference and the formed voxel is more spherical (slightly less wide in the direction of beam propagation). Using a 1,030\\u2009nm excitation wavelength gives a voxel 150\\u2009nm long, a length three times smaller than that of a voxel formed by standard MP3DL (ref.197). However, this geometry is experimentally challenging and limits the achievable height of structures to less than the working distance of the microscope objectives.',\n",
       "  'Employing STED techniques increases the resolution of MP3DL to below the diffraction limit. STED lithography uses two co-propagating beams; one beam excites the material and generates free radicals as per normal MP3DL. However, the second beam is of a higher power (but longer wavelength, and thus lesser photon energy) and stimulates emission from the intermediate state of the photoinitiator to the ground state. This prevents the formation of radicals, which requires electrons to populate the triplet state from the intermediate state96. This strategy works efficiently with low-performance photoinitiators such as isopropylthioxanthone (ITX) that have longer dwell times of electrons in the intermediate state. To efficiently increase resolution, the photoinitiator molecules outside the very centre of the focal volume need to be depleted and to achieve this the point-spread function of the second beam is formed as a bottle beam, limiting the size of the voxel in the lateral and, predominantly, axial directions. This allows the printing of very thin lines that possess a high cross-linking density and thus the creation of structures at very high resolution. It has been demonstrated that a line with a width of only 9\\u2009nm can be produced by STED198and woodpile photonic crystals with rod distances of 200\\u2009nm\\xa0(ref.96).',\n",

Bio-based (plant or animal-derived) substances have been investigated as replacements for photoresins synthesized from petroleum products. These include cellulose199, chitin200, glucose, oils201and starch. An added advantage of photoresins produced out of biomaterials is that they can more closely model the natural environment of cells for biomedical applications. Proteins and polysaccharides, which make up the cell’s extracellular matrix, are most suited for these applications, and substances such as gelatin202, collagen203, fibrinogens204and chitosan205have been tested in this context.

       "  'MP3DL is an important manufacturing method that enables micro-dimensional and nano-dimensional 3D printing and extends to the mesoscale. This makes it a unique choice for specific tasks where 3D architecture, precision and material choice are all important. It is also sometimes used as a tool to replace existing precision 3D machining techniques or established mask-based lithography solutions due to its flexibility, efficiency and wider range of materials. The laser direct writing method itself is evolving due to constant advances in laser technology, opto-mechanics, software automation and their integration, leading to advanced additive manufacturing technology exploiting the control of non-linear light–matter interaction and its spatio-temporal confinement. 2PA in combination with photo-thermal super-linear effects and the contribution of avalanche ionization (AI) opens a pathway to cross-linking non-photosensitized resists and the thresholded dose-dependent response enables 3D greyscale lithography, which is offering improvements in both printing quality and throughput simultaneously9,206,207. This in turn keeps the research field scientifically active.',\n",

Although MP3DL has made a breakthrough in optical additive manufacturing by combining true 3D geometry complexity with a sub-wavelength feature size and the use of different functional materials, combining all these benchmark features in a single sample is still challenging. Manufacturing a complex free-form porous structure with discrete sub-100\\u2009nm features with reasonable throughput and practical reproducibility is not always possible, depending on the material. Typically, one parameter can be optimized at the expense of another, so that a trade-off optimum has to be found.

The application of deep learning and artificial intelligence computational methods will help reach theoretical manufacturing limits faster.',\n",
       "  'Research interest in the development of MP3DL will continue as it is adopted as an advanced additive manufacturing tool in high-technology industries. Although alternative lithography methods coming from microscopy approaches such as light sheet lithography are emerging, their offered advantages in throughput are countered by limitations in flexibility or are bound to special materials208. MP3DL empowers unconventional implementation additive manufacturing on the curved and tapered edges of the 3D substrate, which is an exceptionally promising complement to planar techniques209. Its increased use will be driven by competitively increasing production demands for miniaturization and integration, which inevitably involves third-dimension and multi-material manufacturing and use in new scientific fields that benefit from 3D nano-scale structuring and multi-material objects210. Digital manufacturing on demand with voxel dimensions and tuneable material properties is promising for self-assembling material engineering, intelligent structure fabrication, and degradable and repairable object production. Deep learning and artificial intelligence will soon be integrated to support rapid optimization of exposure protocols for different geometries and novel materials by minimizing the time cost of finding the processing window, scanning overlap and model pre-compensation, which should markedly reduce the number of needed iterations. Exploiting the non-linear response and tuneable properties of polymers will allow for advances in nano-scale 4D printing and offer conceptually new designs for intelligent microstructures such as gradients and anisotropics in refractive index, porosity (filling and surface to volume ratios), and mechanical, electrical and thermal conductivities. This in turn will provide auxetic and negative thermal expansion properties as new standard values of choice for advanced additive manufacturing. Finally, a wealth of opportunities are to be found in combining some of the post-processing and functionalization techniques to synergistically provide new properties. For example, the fabrication of optically active 3D micro-optics and nano-optics cannot be achieved by material engineering, 3D laser printing and high-temperature annealing alone, but can be achieved by successive combinations of these processes211.'],\n",

These molecules are commonly found together in the extracellular fluid of the central nervous system and serum, where they hold significant physiological importance1,2,3. Among these small biomolecules, DA is an important neurotransmitter substance that controls the central nervous system, and cardiovascular, renal, and hormonal functions, which is also greatly relevant to addiction to smoking or drugs and in Parkinson’s disease4,5,6. UA is an end product of purine metabolism, and it is excreted from human biological fluids via urine, feces, and sweat7,8. However, the changes in the concentration of UA in the above-mentioned fluids can cause various diseases and disorders, such as gouty nephropathy, gout arthritis, anemia, and hyperuricemia9,10.

       "  'In the past few decades, the studies and employment of nanoparticles have attracted tremendous attention from more and more researchers11. Among them, metal-organic framework (MOF) particles as crystalline hybrid materials are the most popular candidates, which are made up of metal ions and organic ligands to form some different 3D structures12,13. For example, 1,3,5-benzene tricarboxylic acid is commonly known as trimesic acid (H3BTC), which is a tridentate ligand that can form different MOFs with different metal salt in the same synthetic procedures7. To stimulate more advanced application potential and value of MOF in particle state, a great diversity of MOF hybrids has been synthesized by changing the metal or organic sources, synthetic conditions, and post-synthetic modification, which are widely used in energy storage devices, catalysts, separation, ion conduction, molecular recognition, gas storage, sensing, drug delivery, and others11,14,15. Especially, some researchers highlight MOF-based electrochemical sensors for sensitive and selective detection of DA and UA in our body fluids due to the advantage of large internal surface area, tunable porosity, structural, and functional diversity, and unsaturated metallic sites14,15,16. In addition, Nickel-based MOFs have been widely used in different fields due to their low cost and natural abundance14,17. However, MOFs also had some obvious disadvantages, such as poor conductivity, bad adhesion, irregular shape, and easier to aggregate11,15. Therefore, it is still a huge challenge to obtain pure MOFs as electrochemical electrodes with excellent high sensitivity and extraordinary catalytic properties for the detection of small biomolecules. To solve these drawbacks, some scientists are focused on the sensors by using MOF hybrids with nano-sized precious metal nanoparticles (NPs), such as Pt, Au, Ag, and so on18,19. Among the more extensively exploited precious metal nanoparticles (NPs), gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) have attracted much more special attention as chemical modifiers decorated MOFs due to their excellent specific surface area, small pore size, high electrical conductivity, high catalytic activity, and catalytic selectivity20,21,22,23.',\n",

Therefore, Au@Ni-MOF (Ni(CH3CO2)2) provides an efficient and fast candidate material for electrochemical sensors. By integrating experimental data with DFT simulations, a comprehensive understanding of the interactions between the nanomaterial and target analytes will be achieved, enabling the development of highly sensitive and selective electrochemical sensors for practical applications in healthcare, environmental monitoring, and beyond.

Moreover, the Nyquist plot of the Au@Ni-MOF (Ni(CH3CO2)2) modified electrode displayed a more pronounced slope in the low-frequency region than the pristine Ni-based MOF electrode and the unmodified bare SPCE. This observation signifies an accelerated diffusion-controlled mass transfer in the Au@Ni-MOF (Ni(CH3CO2)2)-modified electrode.',\n",
       "  'Furthermore, the main objective of this work is to design a green synthetic method, based on the use of trimeric acid (H3BTC) as the organic linker source and combined with the precursor of Ni salt. It was observed that our Ni-MOF (Ni(CH3CO2)2) could be easily synthesized at room temperature, indicating that our synthesized Ni-MOF (Ni(CH3CO2)2) had different morphology, catalytic performance, and binding energy, as shown in Fig.1. H3BTC ligand could deprotonate and release protons as H+and BTC3-, which could decrease the pH value of the solution and nickel acetate could provide the metal cation and acetate ion in an aqueous solution40. Acetate ions were easily combined with H+at low temperatures by ultrasonic method to carry out some chemical reactions to connect Ni2+and BTC3-to obtain Ni-based MOF: Ni3(BTC)240. Therefore, the suggested synthesis of the mechanism and principle of Ni-MOF(Ni(CH3CO2)2) was described as shown in Fig.S241. To the best of our knowledge, it was reported that some MOF structures existed in unsaturated metal centers (open metal sites), which could act as Lewis’s acid sites and play important roles in catalytic reactions42,43. The MOF materials that have more open metal sites, will have a better catalytic performance43. Therefore, Ni-MOF (Ni(CH3CO2)2) materials will present excellent catalytic performance, which can be obtained from the following electrochemical experiments.',\n",
       "  'Subsequently, to find a suitable optimum ratio between metals (Au and Ni) for the best electrochemical sensor performance, the electrochemical behaviors of the Au@Ni-MOF (Ni(CH3CO2)2)/SPCE modified electrodes were investigated by CVs and DPV measurements under the conditions of 0.1\\xa0mol·L−1KCl and 1.0 mmol·L−1K3[Fe (CN)6] solution at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1and a potential window between −\\u20090.2 and +\\u20090.6\\xa0V. As shown in Fig.S3, 50 µM DA and UA were added in 0.01\\xa0M phosphate buffer solution (PBS, pH 6.0). An obvious phenomenon is that the anodic peak for Au@Ni-MOF (Ni(CH3CO2)2)/SPCE (0.36\\xa0mM of AuNPs) (curve d) was higher than that of the Ni-MOF (Ni(CH3CO2)2)/SPCE, Au@Ni-MOF (Ni(CH3CO2)2)/SPCE (0.02\\xa0mM of AuNPs), and Au@Ni-MOF (Ni(CH3CO2)2)/SPCE (0.12\\xa0mM of AuNPs) (curve a, b, c respectively). Therefore, with the increase of Au nanoparticles, the anodic peak was getting higher and higher for different Au@Ni-MOF (Ni(CH3CO2)2)/SPCE electrodes. In addition, AuNPs are small in size and MOF materials have a strong adsorption capacity, so it is easier to incorporate small AuNPs inside the MOF. The high conductivity of the AuNPs to reach the surface of the material to act as an electron transmission channel further improved the conductivity of the Au@Ni-MOF (Ni(CH3CO2)2) film. As a result, the Au@Ni-MOF (Ni(CH3CO2)2) (0.12\\xa0mM of AuNPs) and Au@Ni-MOF (Ni(CH3CO2)2) (0.36mM of AuNPs) catalysts were both shown to possess high electrocatalytic performance due to their high density of active sites. However, adding too many AuNPs will cause the composites to be too heavy and easy to fall off from the SPCE, and also easy to aggregate. Therefore, the Au@Ni-MOF (Ni(CH3CO2)2)/SPCE (0.12\\xa0mM of AuNPs) was the most suitable electrochemical sensor for the simultaneous detection of DA and UA. The following experiments will all use the Au@Ni-MOF (Ni(CH3CO2)2) (0.12\\xa0mM of AuNPs) composites to be modified SPCE.',\n",
       "  'Relevant electrode reaction kinetics between the electrochemical reaction response (oxidation peak current: I, µA) and the square root of the various potential scan rates (v1/2, mV s−\\u20091) of DA and UA are studied through conducting CV tests. It can be observed that the measured anodic peak current increases significantly in the presence of DA (Fig.5A,C) was positive shift with the increasing scan rate (from 10 to 400 mV s−\\u20091) than UA (Fig.5B, D), suggesting the electron transfers and reaction rate of DA on the surface of the Au@Ni-MOF (Ni(CH3CO2)2)/SPCE was better than UA. In addition, the correlation was linear with the regression equation of Ip.a.(DA)\\u2009=\\u20091.339x −\\u20096.283 (R2=\\u20090.9887), Ipc(DA) = −\\xa01.240x\\u2009+\\u20095.692 (R2=\\u20090.9928), and Ip.a.(UA)\\u2009=\\u20091.354x −\\u20095.493 (R2=\\u20090.9932) and Ipc(UA) = −\\xa01.167x\\u2009+\\u20095.889 (R2=\\u20090.9947), suggesting two adsorption-controlled processes or electron transfer occurred on Au@Ni-MOF (Ni(CH3CO2)2)/SPCE (Fig.5B,D, respectively). Additionally, the amalgamation of the substantial surface area inherent to Ni-based MOFs and the heightened conductivity of AuNPs, characterized by synergistic effects, conferred advantageous attributes for the adsorption of diminutive biomolecules onto the electrode’s surface. Furthermore, the electrooxidation of DA and UA at the Au@Ni-MOF (Ni(CH3CO2)2) electrode resulted in a more efficient electron transfer process. This efficacy can be attributed to the electrode’s enhanced electrochemical catalytic performance, stemming from its elevated conductivity and expansive surface area.',\n",

       "  'More generally, pH is an important factor affecting the electrochemical performance of many sensors and the pH of the electrolyte medium can affect the kinetics and thermodynamics of the electron transfer process15. Therefore, it is vital to investigate the pH effects and to find the optimal pH value for the detection of DA and UA. The electrochemical behavior of DA (50 µM) and UA (50 µM) was studied by CV measurement at a scan rate of 50 mV s−\\u20091in 0.01\\xa0M PBS at different pH values (3 to 10) in a given potential range of − 0.2–0.6\\xa0V, as shown in Fig.6A,C. When the hydrogen ions decreased in the electrolyte solution, the oxidation peaks current (Ipa) value slowly increased in the range of PH from 3.0 to 6.0, and then sharply decreased within the pH from 6.0 to 10.0, indicating that protons transport plays an important role in the electrochemical reactions, accompanied by proton release and capture15,44. In addition, when the electrolyte solution has too many hydrogen ions, the oxidation peak potential (Epa) of DA and UA both shift from positive to negative with the increase of pH from 3.0 to 10.0, which were in complete agreement with the results of previous studies12,45,46. At the same time, Nafion has been frequently used as a binder will lead to different results at different pH values. Nafion has anionic sulfonic acid groups that can attract ammonium cation converted from DA, which is conducive to DA adsorption and permeation. If the pH values are too low, the proton can interact with the sulfonate group instead of the ammonium cation to hinder DA adsorption and permeation. However, when the pH values are too high, DA may happen to deprotonate in the hydroxyl group, and then suffer a negative charge15. Therefore, it is unbeneficial for DA adsorption and permeation under the conditions of too low pH or too high pH. At last, the two types of Au@Ni-MOF (Ni(CH3CO2)2) exhibited the highest peak current at an intermediate value of pH 6.0 (Fig.6B,D), which was used as an optimal pH for the detection of DA and UA.',\n",
       "  'The effect of pH on the current response of 50 μM DA (A) and UA (C) at Au@Ni-MOF (Ni(CH3CO2)2)/SPCE at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1; Plot of oxidation peak current (Ipa) and oxidation peak potential (Epa) of DA (B) and UA (D) versus pH.',\n",
       "  'Additionally, the DPV method is used for the DA and UA sensing process. Different concentrations of DA and UA were measured separately by this electrochemical sensor under the conditions of 0.01\\xa0M PBS (pH 6.0) at a scan rate of 50 mV s−\\u20091. To obtain a higher sensitivity and linear range under the optimum conditions, a series of experiments were carried out and many good results were demonstrated. As depicted in Fig.7A,C, it can be observed that the DPV curve responds to the individual and simultaneous detection of enhanced DA and UA concentrations on Au@Ni-MOF (Ni(CH3CO2)2)/SPCE, and the oxidation peak currents increased sequentially with the increase of the concentration of each species. Furthermore, all the oxidation peaks showed relatively small increasing red-shifting as the concentration of DA and UA increased. When the DA or UA level was changed from 0 to the maximum, the oxidation peak potentials at the Au@Ni-MOF (Ni(CH3CO2)2)/SPC electrode shifted to the right by about 355.2 mV and 191.3 mV, respectively. Regardless of the DA or UA detection, the peak potential separation of the Au@Ni-MOF (Ni(CH3CO2)2)/SPC electrode showed excellent electrocatalytic activities and electroconductibility. The reasons may be as follows: (1) H3BTC ligands in Au@Ni-MOF (Ni(CH3CO2)2) composites with complete or partial deprotonation may interact with the target molecules via hydrogen bonding, and/or electrostatic interactions, which can activate the multi-carboxylate groups and accelerate the charge transfer kinetics of the target analytes at the Au@Ni-MOF (Ni(CH3CO2)2) materials47,48,49; (2) Au@Ni-MOF (Ni(CH3CO2)2) composite has a particularly high surface area and small pore-size distribution, which are easier for fast electron transfer of DA and UA in aqueous electrolyte23.',\n",
       "  'Additionally, the electrocatalytic peak current density of the electrodes was linearly related to the concentrations of DA and UA, the widely linear range for the individual analysis of each substance was 0.1 µM to 2 mM (DA) and 0.5 µM to 1.5 mM (UA) for Au@Ni-MOF (Ni(CH3CO2)2)/SPCE sensor. According to the description of Fig.7B,D, when the Au@Ni-MOF (Ni(CH3CO2)2)/SPCE sensor separate analysis of the target molecules, the different linear calibration equations for each species were IDA(µA)\\u2009=\\u20090.0935CDA(µM)\\u2009+\\u20090.914 (R2=\\u20090.9917), IDA(µA)\\u2009=\\u20090.0221CDA(µM)\\u2009+\\u20098.562 (R2=\\u20090.9601) and IDA(µA)\\u2009=\\u20090.0122CDA(µM)\\u2009+\\u200917.15 (R2=\\u20090.9949) within three successively increasing concentration ranges between 0.1 and 80 µM, 80–1000 µM and 1000–2000 µM as well as IUA(µA)\\u2009=\\u20090.1189CUA(µM)\\u2009+\\u20093.465 (R2=\\u20090.9968) and IUA(µA)\\u2009=\\u20090.0098CUA(µM)\\u2009+\\u20098.289 (R2=\\u20090.9933) within two successively increasing concentration ranges between 0.5 and 30 µM and 50–1500 µM, respectively. In addition, in the different linear ranges for the electrochemical sensing of DA and UA on Au@Ni-MOF (Ni(CH3CO2)2)/SPCE, the smallest low detection limits (LODs) were calculated to be approximately 0.06 µM and 0.05 µM (S/N=\\u20093), with the highest sensitivity of 0.85 µA mM−\\u20091mm−\\u20092and 1.08 µA mM−\\u20091mm−\\u20092, respectively.',\n",
       "  'What’s more, DPV measurement has higher sensitivity and better resolution than the CV method, so it is a wise choice to use the DPV technique for the simultaneous determination of DA and UA at the Au@Ni-MOF (Ni(CH3CO2)2) electrodes. As depicted in Fig.7E,F, it can be observed that with the increasing concentration of each analyte, the electro-oxidation peaks changed from initially without any peaks to two weak and poorly shaped peaks, and further to an increasingly pronounced doublet peak, until finally the doublet peaks become more and more pronounced. Moreover, for the Au@Ni-MOF (Ni(CH3CO2)2)/SPCE sensor (Fig.7F), the achieved electrocatalytic peak currents had two linear relationships with the DA and UA concentration within the ranges of 0.5–1000 µM. Certainly, it had different linear equations in different concentration range, and the linear regression equations were calibrated as IDA(µA)\\u2009=\\u20090.0415CDA(µM)\\u2009+\\u20090.9435 (R2=\\u20090.9931) and IUA(µA)\\u2009=\\u20090.0322CUA(µM)\\u2009+\\u20090.8820 (R2=\\u20090.9872) between 0.5 and 200 µM, another two equations were obtained as IDA(µA)\\u2009=\\u20090.0187CDA(µM)\\u2009+\\u20090.5476 (R2=\\u20090.9901) and IUA(µA)\\u2009=\\u20090.0219CUA(µM)\\u2009+\\u20092.071 (R2=\\u20090.9644) between 200 and 1000 µM. Moreover, the smallest LOD values and the highest sensitivity for DA and UA in small concentration ranges were calculated at about 0.14 µM and 0.19 µM as well as 0.38 µA µM−\\u20091cm−\\u20092and 0.29 µA µM−\\u20091cm−\\u20092, respectively. These good results demonstrate that simultaneous determination of DA and UA can be achieved with high sensitivity and selectivity at the Au@Ni-MOF (Ni(CH3CO2)2) electrode. On the other hand, whether it was detected individually or simultaneously, the Au@Ni-MOF (Ni(CH3CO2)2)/SPCE sensor showed small LOD and high sensitivity, suggesting that Au@Ni-MOF (Ni(CH3CO2)2) hybrids could present excellent electrocatalytic performance and the ability to transfer electrons. Furthermore, in cooperation with other materials reported in the literature for the simultaneous determination of DA and UA (Table1), the Au@Ni-MOF (Ni(CH3CO2)2) composites exhibited good results as promising electrode materials for electrochemical sensing. Besides, it can be observed that the important analytical parameter of the linear ranges for the Au@Ni-MOF (Ni(CH3CO2)2)/SPC electrode is superior to or comparable to so far reported papers for the individual and simultaneous determination of the two small targets biomolecules. To our knowledge, few reports had direct electrochemical determination of DA and UA in coexistence systems by using MOF-based composites as electrode modifiers, especially via using the MOF-metal particle composites developed in our work to modify the electrodes. At the same time, they are also two very innovative and promising materials as electrodes in the field of electrochemistry. In addition, the Au@Ni-MOF (Ni(CH3CO2)2) materials offer remarkable practical significance and novelty in DA and UA detection. In comparison to other sensor materials, the unique structure of Au@Ni-MOF (Ni(CH3CO2)2) provides a synergistic effect. The presence of gold nanoparticles within the Ni-MOF framework not only enhances the conductivity but also offers catalytic active sites. This leads to a significant improvement in electron transfer kinetics, which is directly reflected in the higher sensitivity and lower limit of detection we have obtained. For instance, in contrast to some commonly used carbon-based sensor materials, our Au@Ni-MOF (Ni(CH3CO2)2) composites show a more pronounced electrocatalytic activity towards DA and UA oxidation, allowing for more accurate and reliable detection even at low analyte concentrations. Moreover, the stability and reproducibility of our material in complex biological samples outperform many traditional sensor materials, making it more suitable for practical applications.',\n",

The calculations were executed using the DMol3 module, a computational tool incorporated within the Material Studio software38,57. For the systems under investigation, which encompassed DA and UA, the electron density and molecular orbitals were computed. The obtained results, as illustrated in Fig.S4, are presumably pivotal for understanding the electronic structure and reactivity of these molecules.',\n",
       "  'Moreover, computational chemistry techniques play a pivotal role in elucidating the biological activity of specific molecules, complemented by an abundance of theoretical investigations aimed at discerning their chemical reactivity58. In electronic structure theory, the Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital (HOMO) is the molecular orbital with the highest energy, while the Lowest Unoccupied Molecular Orbital (LUMO) has the lowest energy. The energy gap between these two orbitals, known as the HOMO-LUMO gap or Eg, represents the minimum energy required to move an electron from the HOMO to the LUMO57,58,59,60. HOMO-LUMO determination and its other several important key factors for conductivity activity which as energy gap (ΔEg), hardness (η), softness (σ), and the global electronegativity (χ) were calculated by using Eqs.\\xa0(1)–(4)58,59,60, as shown in TableS2.',\n",
       "  'Based on the data presented in Fig.S4and TableS2, it is evident that UA has a smaller HOMO-LUMO gap value compared to DA. A smaller value of this descriptor indicates higher molecular activity58. This discrepancy suggests that DA is more favorable for electron excitation, potentially enhancing electrical conductivity. Furthermore, an increase in softness and a decrease in hardness values are associated with increased biological activity58. Based on the hardness (η) and softness (σ) values of DA and UA, it is evident that UA has a better softness than DA, indicating that UA is much more active than DA. Another important parameter is global electronegativity (χ). Global electronegativity is associated with the electron’s freedom within a molecule. A lower electronegativity value signifies that electrons within the molecule are more mobile compared to other molecules. Inhibitors typically coordinate with suitable acceptor molecules by donating electrons. As a result, biological activity increases as the global electronegativity value decreases58. According to their global electronegativity values, DA exhibits higher activity than UA.',\n",
       "  'Additionally, the adsorption energy or interaction energy, Eads, was determined using Eq.\\xa0(5)57.',\n",
       "  'In this equation, “Eads” represents the adsorption energy, and “Ecomplex” signifies the total energy of the complex formed after the adsorption of the target analytes (DA and UA) onto the surfaces of Ni-MOF (Ni(CH3CO2)2) or Au@Ni-MOF (Ni(CH3CO2)2). “Esubstrate” and “Eadsorbent” correspond to the individual energies of the target analytes and the Ni-MOF (Ni(CH3CO2)2) or Au@Ni-MOF (Ni(CH3CO2)2) materials, respectively. Furthermore, as illustrated in Fig.S5 and detailed in Table S3, the adsorption energy for two DA molecules was notably higher at −\\xa0536.63\\xa0kJ/mol in comparison to the scenario where two UA molecules were adsorbed or when one DA and one UA interacted, yielding an energy of −\\xa0404.95\\xa0kJ/mol and −\\u2009434.74\\xa0kJ/mol, respectively. It is worth highlighting that the adsorption energy of Au@Ni-MOF (Ni(CH3CO2)2), when both DA and UA were involved, surpassed that of Ni-MOF (Ni(CH3CO2)2) in isolation. This indicates that the incorporation of AuNPs resulted in an overall increase in energy and an enhancement of the adsorption energy for specific small biomolecules. These observations strongly imply that DA exhibits a significantly stronger adsorption affinity for the surface of both Ni-MOF (Ni(CH3CO2)2) and Au@Ni-MOF (Ni(CH3CO2)2) composites in comparison to UA. Consequently, UA can be more swiftly adsorbed onto Au@Ni-MOF (Ni(CH3CO2)2)/SPCE with a higher affinity, leading to LOD for DA as opposed to UA. In summary, the Au@Ni-MOF (Ni(CH3CO2)2)/SPCE sensor is anticipated to demonstrate superior capabilities in detecting DA when compared to UA, aligning with the findings presented in Fig.7.',\n",

The relative standard deviations (RSDs) of the electrode responses to DA and UA twenty times by using two different electrodes in the DPV curves were calculated at 0.32% and 1.38%, respectively. From the above computational results, we can deduce that the Au@Ni-MOF (Ni(CH3CO2)2)/SPCE sensor could show outstanding reproducibility, suggesting that the small changes can be ignored by using different electrodes for the simultaneous detection of DA and UA. Furthermore, it is shown that the Au@Ni-MOF (Ni(CH3CO2)2)/SPCE sensor has a lower value for the detection of DA than UA, demonstrating that the Au@Ni-MOF (Ni(CH3CO2)2) material can exhibit excellent electrocatalytic performance and carry out much electron transfer in the detection process.',\n",

Among, DA and UA decreased by 1.56%, and 1.16% for the Au@Ni-MOF (Ni(CH3CO2)2) electrode, respectively. On the other hand, to study the selectivity of the electrochemical sensor for DA and UA detection, various possible interferences were investigated, including glucose, urea, NaCl, NaNO3, NaF, CaCl2, ZnSO4, and ascorbic acid.

These results demonstrated that the peak currents of DA and UA oxidation don’t produce remarkable changes after adding these interfering species one by one.

However, the commercialization of ASSLBs has been hindered, due in large part to the growth of lithium dendrites5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12. The penetration of dendrites into solid electrolytes (SEs) poses a significant concern, as it can readily result in mechanical failure or fracture of the SEs, risking potentially catastrophic battery failure. It had been originally anticipated that SEs would prevent the dendrites penetration by virtue of their mechanical rigidity. However, recent experiments have demonstrated dendrite formation and growth in SE systems, such as garnets, thiophosphates, and argyrodites, are much easier than in their liquid counterparts13,14. Obviously, the mechanism of dendrite penetration in ASSLBs remains to be clarified.',\n",

In the context of fracture mechanics, one viewpoint insists that stress accumulates within defects during lithium deposition, ultimately surpassing the mechanical strength of SE and resulting in the formation of cracks9,11,12,15,16,17,18,19,20. In return, the newly formed crack provides vacant space for continuous dendrite growth. The alternative argument suggests that dendrite penetration arises from electrochemical degradation, wherein lithium ions are preferentially reduced to lithium metal at grain boundaries and defects. The resultant lithium metal typically forms as isolated deposits away from the electrode surface. These deposits gradually interconnect, culminating in battery failure5,8,21,22,23. Other potential mechanisms, such as stress corrosion24and dislocation climbing25,26, have also been proposed to explain the penetration behavior.

During deposition, stress progressively builds up within the dendrite, resulting in the fracture of the SE—a process influenced by both mechanics and electrochemistry. By accounting for the effect of lithium-ion concentration on fracture toughness, Griffith’s theory proves effective in quantitatively assessing dendrite-induced fractures. Grain boundaries significantly influence dendrite propagation direction and lithium-ion concentration distribution. Combining simulations and experiments indicates that dendrite-induced fracture at grain boundaries displays a mixed Mode I and Mode II fracture pattern. This behavior is determined by the fracture toughness of the grain boundaries and the relative orientation of dendrites.',\n",

Recent studies have indicated that the FCC phase is the ground state structure of lithium metal, and high pressure plays a key role in maintaining the FCC phase. The presence of numerous amorphous phases and grain boundaries (Supplementary Fig.7) provides multiple pathways for the slip motion of lithium metal, promoting mobility and maintaining uniform pressure inside the dendrite (Fig.2g).

In this model, the dendrite is initially inclined at an angleθto the grain boundary of the SE (Supplementary Fig.14b). Both the grain and grain boundary are treated as uniform and isotropic materials. Based on our previous findings, the pressure within the dendrite is assumed to be uniform. Detailed derivations of the model are provided in the Methods section. Figure7dshows the phase diagram of intergranular and transgranular cracks as a function of incidence angle and fracture toughness ratio (ω=\\\\({K}_{IIc}^{GB}/{K}_{Ic}^{gen}\\\\)), derived from the theoretical model. The results indicate that dendrite transgranular growth is confined to a narrow range of parameters (ω>\\u20090.43 andθ>\\u200973°, indicated by the blue region in Fig.7d). For instance, using the toughness of the R3 grain boundary as a reference, transgranular growth of dendrites is observed only forθ>\\u200978°. Specifically, at the ∑3(112) grain boundary, dendrites grow along the grain boundary at all observed angles. The pronounced reduction in\\\\({K}_{IIc}^{GB}\\\\)significantly increases the likelihood of dendrites deflecting and propagating along grain boundaries. These results are consistent with experimental observations, showing that dendrites seldom penetrate across grain boundaries, rather they predominantly move along them instead29,30,44,45,46. Thus, improving the mechanical properties of grain boundaries and strategically designing and optimizing their pathways are crucial for mitigating and controlling dendrite penetration.',\n",
       "  'We would like to point out that this work focuses on investigating the process of dendrite penetration into SEs and the concurrent development of cracks during cell operation. To facilitate dendrite penetration, a virtual wall is adhered to the LLZO, confining the deposited lithium ions within the defect (Supplementary Fig.15). As deposition continues, the dendrite gradually expands and ultimately penetrates the SE. This boundary condition setup aligns with scenarios where the inflow rate of lithium atoms into the defect exceeds the outflow rate (Supplementary Fig.16), particularly under conditions of high current rates, large defect sizes, or significant stack pressure.',\n",
       "  'In reality, whether dendrites nucleate and penetrate the electrolyte or deposit uniformly is influenced by various factors, such as current density, applied external pressure, and defect size. For example, we remove the virtual wall adhered to the LLZO, allowing lithium atoms to deposit freely. This setup simulates the scenario of a cell without stack pressure. In the absence of external pressure, SEs generally suffer from serious interface contact loss and uneven interfacial contact during repeated lithium plating and stripping, leading to local current concentrations that trigger lithium dendrite growth (Supplementary Fig.17). As shown in Supplementary Fig.18, under high pressure, the lithium atoms are pushed back and tend to deposit vertically upwards, aligning with experimental studies50.',\n",
       "  'In contrast, applying moderate stack pressure can help maintain close interfacial contact during cycling (Supplementary Fig.19). To simulate this scenario, we reposition the virtual wall to a certain distance above the LLZO to provide downward pressure, allowing the deposited lithium to propagate laterally outside the defect (Supplementary Fig.20). When the defect size is small, lithium atoms flow out of the defect, resulting in uniform deposition without dendrite formation (Supplementary Fig.21). However, when the initial defect size is large, dendrites nucleate and continue to grow, even as some lithium atoms flow out (Supplementary Fig.22). Moreover, the effect of current density on dendrite nucleation is shown in Supplementary Fig.23. Electric field values ranging from 0.1 to 0.03\\u2009V/Å are selected for comparison. A lower current density slows the inflow rate of lithium atoms into the defect, allowing the deposited lithium to gradually propagate laterally outside the defect, thereby promoting uniform deposition. Thus, to prevent dendrite nucleation, several strategies are proposed, such as charging at a low current rate or reducing interfacial defect size through mechanical polishing, applied stack pressure, and surface treatments to improve adhesion.',\n",
       "  'In addition, our simulation method primarily converts lithium ions to metallic lithium, without considering electron trapping at grain boundaries. This limitation arises from the molecular simulation framework’s inability to adequately account for electron transfer and leakage processes. Therefore, the current MD model cannot adequately describe the electrochemical degradation behavior at grain boundaries. A more comprehensive understanding of the complex mechanisms of lithium plating and stripping requires further analysis through multiscale modeling techniques51,52.',\n",
       "  'In summary, large-scale MD simulations are performed to enable direct atomic-scale investigation in the process of dendrite penetration into SEs and the concurrent development of cracks during cell operation. Our findings demonstrate that the fracture process is governed by both mechanical and electrochemical dynamics. Specifically, as lithium ions are deposited, internal stress within the dendrites builds up, eventually causing SE fracture at the dendrite tip. While Griffith’s theory remains applicable for evaluating dendrite-induced fractures in battery systems, it tends to underestimate the critical stress required for fracture. This discrepancy primarily arises from an increase in the SE’s toughness due to the localized reduction in lithium-ion concentration. In polycrystalline SEs, initial defects or dendrite nuclei within the grain often deflect towards and propagate along the grain boundaries. Both simulations and experiments demonstrate fracture at grain boundaries predominantly occurring in a mixed mode. Notably, a decrease in Mode II fracture toughness at grain boundaries is identified as a key factor driving intergranular crack. These findings offer atomic insights into the penetration mechanisms of dendrites and contribute essential knowledge towards improving the performance of SEs.',\n",
       "  'The atomistic modeling of dendrite penetration in LLZO includes an initial lithium metal dendrite, the LLZO, and the source of lithium ions. We selected a partially formed dendrite as the initial structure to ensure computational efficiency. The interactions among the LLZO atoms are modeled with the Buckingham–Coulomb potential53, which can describe both the short-range nuclear repulsion and long-range Coulombic attraction or repulsion. This potential is also effective in describing the interactions between vacancies54. The interactions between lithium metal atoms are modeled with the second nearest-neighbor embedded MEAM force field55. The UFF force field56is used to describe the interactions between lithium atoms and LLZO. Details of the force field parameters, along with validations—such as surface energies, elastic parameters, phase change behavior, lattice constants, lithium-ion diffusivity in LLZO, and the interfacial adhesion at the lithium-LLZO interface—are provided in\\xa0Supplementary Notes1and2. Periodic boundary conditions are applied inxandzdirections, and the boundaries are left free in theydirection (Fig.1a). In this work, using the NVT ensemble would have inevitably introduced boundary pressures that could affect the crack behavior of the SE. Therefore, we selected the NPT ensemble to avoid such issues. The size-dependent behavior under the NPT ensemble condition and the validity of the results are discussed in Supplementary Note3. MD simulations are performed using an NPT ensemble at a constant temperature of 300\\u2009K. An electric field of 0.1\\u2009VÅ−1is applied to the system along y direction to accelerate the lithium ions diffusion. In MD simulations of the lithium battery charging process, a weak electric field may fail to provide a sufficient driving force for ion motion, resulting in low computational efficiency. Conversely, an excessively high electric field may separate cations and anions, damaging the material. Our selected electric field value provides an optimal balance between computational efficiency and maintaining structural integrity (Supplementary Note4). A cutoff radius of 1.75\\u2009Å, corresponding to the deposition energy barrier of 0.05\\u2009eV, is selected for converting lithium ions into atoms within LLZO. Lithium ions within this radius from lithium metal atoms undergo transformation into metal atoms. This energy barrier closely aligns with the nucleation barrier for lithium plating in Li|LLZO cells57. The relationship between the lithium deposition energy barrier and cutoff radius is illustrated in Supplementary Fig.32. Simultaneously, an equivalent number of lithium ions are randomly generated in the lithium source region to maintain charge balance within the system. (Supplementary Fig.1). The LLZO polycrystalline structures with a Σ5(310) grain boundary were constructed, consisting of two LLZO grains with their Zr sub-lattice (310) planes inclined at an angle of 36.9° relative to each other (Supplementary Fig.33a).

       " 'paper_6.html': ['With the advent of Big Data, energy resources spent on information technologies are growing exponentially1. One of the reasons for this is that most memory systems utilize electric currents to write data, which dissipates power by Joule heating2. Control of magnetic memories with electric fields instead of electric currents has emerged as a leading strategy to minimize this problem3,4,5,6. Among the various mechanisms to tune magnetism with voltage (electrostatic charging, strain-mediated multiferroic coupling or electrochemical reactions3,7), magneto-ionics, which involves the manipulation of magnetic properties through voltage-driven insertion/removal of ions, provides unprecedented performance for non-volatile control of coercivity, anisotropy, exchange bias or magnetization, ultimately causing conversion between magnetic and non-magnetic states8,9,10,11,12,13,14. So far, most investigated magneto-ionic systems are continuous thin films utilizing different ion species (O2–, N3–, H+, Li+, etc.). Reports on magneto-ionic effects in nanoscale lithographed dots are scarce15,16. From the fundamental viewpoint, in-situ measurements of voltage-driven ion motion in nanometer-sized structures might unveil changes in the magnetization reversal mechanisms, which may allow precise, analog control of magnetic bit properties that can be used to create novel neuromorphic functionalities.',\n",
       "  'At the nanoscale, unique magnetization switching mechanisms and topological spin configurations emerge, such as skyrmions or vortices. Magnetic vortices hold promise in applications such as multi-state data storage17, racetrack memories18, biomedicine19, spin-logics20, or spin-torque nano-oscillators21, where the latter is relevant to microwave generation/detection22and neuromorphic computing23. Magnetic vortices compete with other spin configurations such as single-domain (SD), C- or S-states, or double-vortices24,25. The ground state of the system is determined by the interplay between exchange and magnetostatic energy and is traditionally controlled by tuning the aspect ratio of as-grown nanostructures according to existing phase diagrams. This implies that altering the magnetization reversal mechanism and the magnetic properties of nanodots after sample growth is not straightforward. Post-synthesis manipulation of magnetic vortices has been accomplished, to some extent, by spin-torque effects26, laser pulse excitation27, or through the coupling with adjacent antiferromagnets28, all requiring significant energy resources. Consequently, alternative approaches to controlling magnetism in nanoscale objects, by harnessing electric fields rather than relying on electrical currents or heating processes, are needed.',\n",

However, strain-mediated coupling cannot induce an analog modulation of the magnetization amplitude, crucial for mimicking weights in artificial synapses,32nor can it be used to precisely control the nucleation/annihilation fields of vortex states. Furthermore, strain-coupled devices suffer from long-term fatigue and eventual cracking that limit their useful lifetime. Moreover, the magnetic state of each nanodot is often unpredictably influenced by the local strain stemming from the complex ferroelectric domain structure of the substrate. Considering all the shortcomings of existing strategies, the analog modification of magnetic properties via voltage-induced migration of ions in nanometer-sized dots arises as an unparalleled alternative.',\n",
       "  'Here, we demonstrate the operation principle of an analog magnetic vortex controlled by electric-field-driven ion motion (“vortion” or magneto-ionic vortex). Such state is generated from paramagnetic FeCoN nanodots upon voltage-driven gradual extraction of N3–ions. The characteristic properties of vortions (nucleation and annihilation fields, coercivity, or remanence) can be fully controlled with voltage. While these objects show some resemblance to conventional magnetic vortices, a unique feature of vortions is that the amplitude of their magnetization, akin to synaptic weight, can be dynamically reconfigured in an analog manner by adjusting the voltage actuation time. Additionally, voltage can induce a reversible transition among three distinct states via migration of N3–ions – paramagnetic, single-domain and magneto-ionic vortex– which is not possible using conventional methods. Such control exploits a rather unique, so far overlooked, aspect of N3–magneto-ionics: contrary to O2–magneto-ionics (where voltage generates ferromagnetic clusters within a paramagnetic matrix), diffusion of N3–ions results in the formation of a planar migration front, dividing the nanodot into sub-layers with dissimilar composition and magnetic features.',\n",

Energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX) reveals a Fe:Co atomic ratio of 65:35 (Fig.1d). This composition was chosen since it shows the largest nitrogen magneto-ionic effects reported so far33. To trigger ionic migration, we employed an electrolyte-gated setup in a capacitor configuration within a custom-made electrochemical cell (Fig.1b) that allowed us to track real-time alterations of magnetic properties using magneto-optical Kerr effect (MOKE). Propylene carbonate (PC) with Na+- and OH−-solvated species was employed as an anhydrous polar liquid electrolyte. Its role is twofold: to act as a reservoir for N3–ions, and to facilitate the creation of an electric double layer (EDL), which comprises a sub-nm-thick layer of solvated ions drawn to the interface between the gated layer and the electrolyte. This generates a strong electric field capable of efficiently transporting N3–ions into and out of FeCoN, depending on the gate voltage (VG) polarity6. Once in PC, N3–ions are stabilized by PC solvation shells, possibly forming transient ion pairs with Na+cations. The as-grown FeCoN nanodots are paramagnetic with virtually no Kerr amplitude (Fig.1e, purple line, and Supplementary Fig.2a). Upon application ofVG=\\u2009–25\\u2009V, N3–ions begin to migrate towards the PC, generating ferromagnetic phases within each FeCoN nanodot. After 6\\u2009min, an appreciable, narrow hysteresis loop emerges, characterized by a Kerr amplitude of 0.5 mdeg (Supplementary Fig.2b). Interestingly, with increasing actuation time, not only does the Kerr amplitude increase, but the shape of hysteresis loops undergoes a transformation, from square-like (short actuation times) to constricted loops (longer actuation times) (Supplementary Fig.2c, d), typical of vortex formation24,34,35,36. When a voltage of opposite polarity is applied (VG=\\u2009+25\\u2009V), N3–ions are reintroduced from the electrolyte into the FeCo(N) layer. This results in a decrease of the Kerr amplitude (Fig.1f), accompanied by a change of hysteresis loops’ shape (from vortex-like to square-like) and, finally, recovery of the paramagnetic FeCoN state (Supplementary Fig.2e–h).

For short actuation time, a thin ferromagnetic layer (highly or fully depleted in nitrogen) is formed, resulting in a low Kerr amplitude and square-like hysteresis loops. This indicates the presence of single domain (SD) state and magnetization reversal by coherent rotation (orange regions). Conversely, for extended actuation at –25\\u2009V, the ferromagnetic layer thickness increases gradually, which stabilizes the magneto-ionic vortex state and provides a means to fine-tune its magnetization amplitude and critical fields (blue regions). The grey regions indicate transient states, representing the transitional phases between the SD and vortex states, and vice versa. The black dotted vertical lines delimitate the regions where the magneto-ionic vortex state is fully stable.eSchematic representation of the transition between paramagnetic (PM), SD and magneto-ionic vortex states within the same FeCo(N) nanodot driven by N3–ion migration when a gate voltageVGis applied.',\n",
       "  'Remarkably, upon application ofVG=\\u2009– 25\\u2009V, once in the vortion regime, bothHAandHNclearly evolve with time, where increasing voltage actuation time dynamically impacts the stability of the vortex state. Specifically, when coming from positive saturation (descending branch of the hysteresis loops), extending the voltage actuation time results in the vortex state nucleating earlier and annihilating later. Thus, longer application of voltage leads to increased stability of the vortex state. Micromagnetic simulations and analytical calculations show that inter-dot dipolar interactions have a minimal impact on the annihilation field, reducing it by less than 6 % for the thickest generated magnetic phase (Supplementary SectionII) and even less for thinner layers. This effect contrasts with the observed behavior ofHAover time (wherebyHAincreases -instead of decreasing- with the layer thickness), shown in Fig.2c, further supporting the conclusion that the increase inHAstems from the enhanced stability of the vortex state.',\n",
       "  'Our observations are consistent with an increase in thickness of the formed ferromagnetic phase as depicted in Fig.2e. Commencing with paramagnetic FeCoN, brief negative voltage actuation induces the formation of a thin ferromagnetic layer within FeCoN nanodots, giving rise to a SD state and magnetization reversal through coherent rotation. This layer could be FeCo alloy or (Fe,Co)4N, both of which are ferromagnetic. With prolonged negative voltage application, the thickness of the ferromagnetic layer gradually increases, destabilizing the SD state and causing the nucleation of the vortex state25. The progressive increase in the thickness of the ferromagnetic layer further stabilizes the vortex configuration (thereby increasingHNandHA), in agreement with the literature35,37. Importantly, in our case, magneto-ionic actuation allows precise tuning of the magnetic phase thickness within the same sample. This allows accurate post-synthesis control over the magnetization reversal mechanism and enables analog modulation of magnetization along with the other characteristic parameters of the magneto-ionic vortex state. Several paramagnetic⟷single domain⟷vortion cycles are shown in the Supplementary Fig.4.',\n",

Figure3displays two hysteresis loops obtained by MOKE after voltage treatments for varying durations, together with overlaid MFM phase images collected at different values of in-plane magnetic field. Results in panel a) were obtained for short actuation times, giving rise to magnetization reversal via coherent rotation (i.e., rotating dipolar contrast as a function of magnetic field). Conversely, for long-term actuation (Fig.3b), one can observe magnetization reversal via vortex formation in agreement with the constriction observed in the hysteresis loop. Formation of the vortex is evidenced by a featureless MFM phase contrast, with a signal arising only from the discernible vortex cores (Fig.3c)38,39,40that have magnetization perpendicular to the plane of nanodots. Direct evidence of vortex formation in long-term treated 280\\u2009nm dots was obtained through magnetic imaging at the Photoemission Electron Microscope (PEEM) endstation at the ALBA Synchrotron, using X-ray circular magnetic dichroism (XMCD) contrast (see Section “Methods”). Figure3d–fshows XMCD-PEEM images at CoL3edge, where the characteristic bright-dark magnetic contrast observed in an array of six 280-nm nanodots after long-term negative voltage treatment (Fig.3d) unequivocally demonstrates the formation of the magnetic vortex state.

An analogous behavior is evident in the opposite case scenario, albeit with significantly higherHCvalues. Enhancement ofHCat the transition between SD and vortex states has been previously reported.41Superimposed to this behavior is a steady increase ofHC, observed while going from SD to vortex state and vice versa, which is persistent over time. The increase ofHCunder negative voltage is consistent with the formation of FeCo or (Fe,Co)4N magnetic phases. As previously observed in FeCoN films, a reduction in nitrogen content (i.e., from FeCoNxto FeCo) results in progressively higher magnetization and coercivity42,43. The final coercivity values during positive gating (≈170\\u2009Oe) are substantially higher compared to initial values (≈50\\u2009Oe) when negative voltage is applied, indicating the presence of magnetic phases with dissimilar nitrogen content at the beginning and at the end of gating with negative and positive voltages, respectively.',\n",
       "  'To elucidate the ion migration mechanism in FeCoN nanodots, we conducted high-resolution TEM (HR-TEM), high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) and electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) compositional mapping on cross-sectional lamellae extracted from as-grown and – 25\\u2009V treated samples. EELS compositional maps for each sample state were collected in two distinct regions, as indicated by rectangles in HAADF-STEM images of the nanodot’s cross-sections (Fig.4a, d), covering the entire nanodot and its interior. Additionally, for each state, we measured EELS compositional line profile across the nanodot (Fig.4g, h). A uniform distribution of Fe, Co, and N ions within the dot is observed in the as-grown sample (Fig.4b, c, g). Following the application of negative voltage, ions within the sample exhibit a distinct, altered distribution. Specifically, positively charged Fe ions migrate towards the bottom interface with Pt, where they accumulate (Fig.4e,\\xa0f, h, blue line). Upon treatment, the concentration of Co ions also slightly increases towards the bottom interface of the nanodot. Similar motion of Ni2+ions upon voltage application has been recently reported in gated NiO films44. A more intriguing aspect lies in the distinct behavior of negatively charged N3–ions, exhibiting a counter-directional migration compared to transition metal ions, that following partial release into the electrolyte, also accumulate at the top interface of the FeCoN films. This generates a distinctive planar migration front which subdivides the FeCoN dot into two sub-layers with dissimilar nitrogen content: N-depleted or N-free (at the bottom) and N-rich (top) of the nanodot (Fig.4f, h). This nitrogen accumulation phenomenon has been observed in systems characterized by relatively fast nitrogen magneto-ionic effects. When nitrogen diffuses faster than it dissolves, the EDL becomes saturated with N3–ions, locally surpassing the solubility limit of nitrogen in PC. In this scenario, N3–ions reach a point where they cannot be released further into the liquid, resulting in their accumulation at the upper part of the FeCoN nanodot33,45. EELS maps allowed us to estimate the thickness of the magneto-ionically induced magnetic layer in this case to be ≈11–12\\u2009nm.

       "  'The observed evolution of magnetic properties upon gating was modelled using micromagnetic simulations. Figure5shows simulations of the magnetization reversal processes while applying – 25\\u2009V. As described in the “Methods” section, the thicknesses were chosen based on experimentally estimated values, and the magnitudes ofMSandKuwere tuned to obtain coercivities and saturation fields similar to experimental ones (Fig.2). Importantly, an increase of bothMSandKuwith increasing thickness is needed to match the experimental loop characteristics (see Supplementary Figs.9and10for details). This is consistent with a progressive loss of N content in the nanodots (in our case caused by voltage), as reported in the literature for FeCoN42. For the thinnest disks (Fig.5a) the reversal process occurs via quasi-coherent rotation (with minor curling prior to saturation) and the loop shape andHCof 50\\u2009Oe agree well with the experimental hysteresis loop (Supplementary Fig.2b). For intermediate and large thicknesses (Fig.5b, c), vortex reversal is observed, also in agreement with the experimental results. Note that the concomitant increase ofHCandHAwith gating time is captured by the simulations. In this context, although vortions resemble conventional magnetic vortices, they exhibit unique characteristic of finite coercivity, which, along with the associated anisotropy, prevents the complete closure of experimentally measured hysteresis loops, consistent with micromagnetic simulations. The high-coercivity square hysteresis loop measured after long-time gating at +25\\u2009V (Supplementary Fig.2g) was also modelled. For this, a highKuwas used compared to the value for 2\\u2009nm thick disks initially formed at –25\\u2009V. During the +25\\u2009V treatment, the nitrogen front will move from the top to the bottom of the disks, resulting in a thinner ferromagnetic layer, but with material parameters similar to those of the previously generated thickest dots. Besides the high anisotropy, we slightly decreased the inter-grain exchange coupling to 30 % to match the experimental value ofHC(Supplementary Fig.11). This is plausible since nitrogen ions might preferentially diffuse along grain boundaries and, in addition, grains might become less interconnected at progressively smaller thicknesses.',\n",

       "  'We have shown that voltage can serve as an energy-efficient actuation method for tuning magnetization reversal mechanism and magnetic properties of FeCoN nanodots between paramagnetic, SD and magneto-ionic vortex states. Under the action of electric field, N3–ions diffuse via planar front formation, enabling the thickness of formed magnetic counterpart to gradually increase. This migration front, not present in other magneto-ionic systems, not only allows control over the magnetization reversal mechanism but also provides the capability to adjust magnetization and critical fields on-demand. The analog tuning of the vortex state, as demonstrated here, offers unique advantages over alternative methods like strain-mediated actuation relying on ferroelectric substrates, spin-transfer torque effects, or coupling with adjacent antiferromagnets, where the magnetization amplitude is held constant. In this context, vortions hold the potential to introduce innovative concepts in neuromorphic computing. Specifically, if integrated within spin-transfer-torque nano-oscillators—employed to emulate neurons46—the magneto-ionic vortex is poised to offer tunable magnetic synaptic weights through voltage-driven modulation of magnetization. Furthermore, alteration of magnetic anisotropy within the nanodots, as also demonstrated in this study, could impact the gyroscopic frequency of precessing vortex cores.47This, in turn, could influence the magnetization dynamics of neighboring oscillators, akin to the way in which spikes affect post-synaptic neurons, therefore further expanding the applicability of magneto-ionic vortices in neuromorphic spintronics systems and multi-state analog computing.',\n",

       " 'paper_7.html': ['Detection of high-energy photons in the vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) region presents unique challenges due to the need for specialized materials and conditions. Spanning the wavelength range from 100\\xa0to 200\\xa0nm1, VUV radiation is strongly absorbed by oxygen in air, thus requiring its propagation through vacuum. Despite these challenges, the growing demand for VUV sensors in applications ranging from space science to surface treatment has driven significant advancements in both VUV detectors and light-emitting devices2,3,4. Molecular spectroscopy, gas chromatography, surface sterilization, photochemical processing, surface treatment, and photolithography are some examples of scientific and technological research that rely on VUV radiation. Recently, there has also been increasing reliance on VUV radiation in space science where one of the most effective ways of monitoring evolution of stars and space weather is through the detection of these high energy radiation5,6,7. Scintillators are being developed as intermediary materials that absorb the VUV radiation, subsequently converting it to UV or visible radiation via its luminescence8,9,10,11,12. Scintillators work through the excitation of electrons upon absorption of radiation by the scintillator material, followed by the de-excitation of electrons that result to the emission of photons (luminescence). The conversion of high energy VUV to lower energy UV or visible radiation enables the detection of the luminescence using a photodetector such as a photomultiplier tube that converts the luminescence to an electrical signal. A more efficient approach is to use photoconductive detectors, which directly convert VUV light into electrical signals, bypassing the need for intermediary scintillator materials and improving response time and sensitivity. In photoconductive detectors, the absorbed radiation excites electrons from the valence band to the conduction band, leading to the generation of electron-hole pairs that are free to move through the material. When an external electric field (E-field) is applied across the photoconductive material, the photo-generated carriers move in the direction of the E-field registering as photocurrent. The magnitude of the photocurrent is indicative of the number of photons absorbed, thus providing a direct measurement of the intensity of the incident VUV radiation.',\n",

Compared to diamond, p- and n-type doping is easier in cubic boron nitride (c-BN) and therefore it has better photoconductivity characteristics, but the quality of c-BN is still low24,25. Recently, amorphous boron nitride26, hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN)27,28, and fluorides29,30,31,32,33,34have also attracted attention as VUV photodetectors.',\n",
       "  'ZnO has excellent optical and electrical properties as a direct transition semiconductor with a large band gap energy of about 3.37\\xa0eV and high exciton binding energy of 60 meV35. Owing to these characteristics, it is ubiquitous in a wide range of applications including transparent conducting films, UV sensors, and transistors. ZnO films have not yet been investigated as a photoconductive detector in the VUV region. As a VUV photoconductive detector, it is essential to control its electrical conduction properties which are strongly influenced by intrinsic defects and crystallinity as these affect charge carrier density and mobility. Therefore, it is necessary to control the population of defects and the degree of crystallinity to optimize their photoconductivity especially in the VUV region. Previous works have investigated the effect of different deposition methods and parameters on the crystallinity and defects of ZnO thin films, including the effect of increasing the substrate temperature in improving the crystallinity and reducing defect density using plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) and pulsed laser deposition (PLD)36,37, the influence of increasing oxygen pressure in making more transparent films at low temperature by PLD37, effect of annealing temperature and annealing atmosphere on the quality of ZnO films fabricated by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE)38, controlling the defects and crystallite size by regulating the oxygen partial pressure and annealing using vacuum DC sputtering39, the effect of substrate on films deposited by PLD40, and the effect of RF power on the crystallinity and optical properties of RF magnetron-sputtered films41. Films deposited at 175\\xa0W RF power had poor crystalline quality because of severe surface damage brought about by a very fast reaction rate41. In this work, we use pulsed reactive magnetron sputtering operating in the medium-frequency range (MF magnetron) assisted by an electron cyclotron wave resonance (ECWR) plasma (MF\\u2009+\\u2009ECWR magnetron)42to deposit µm-thick ZnO films on soda-lime glass (SLG) substrates. We show that the amount of defects and the crystallinity of ZnO films can be easily controlled by changing the ECWR power. By doing so, we are able to tune the electrical conduction properties of ZnO films and determine the optimal ECWR power for the development of highly photosensitive ZnO films in the VUV region.',\n",
       "  'ZnO films were deposited on SLG substrates using MF\\u2009+\\u2009ECWR with ECWR power (PECWR) of 0\\xa0W (MF only), 100\\xa0W, 200\\xa0W, 300\\xa0W, and 380\\xa0W. For all PECWR, the MF power was kept constant at 300\\xa0W. Figure1a shows the grazing incidence x-ray diffraction (GIXRD) spectra of the grown films. All films grew along thec-axis and have a wurtzite-type structure with the dominant peak along the (002) plane. In general, thec-axis orientation is increasingly favored as PECWRis increased as shown in Fig.1b; Table1. The dominant peak broadens and shifts to the left for PECWRequal to or greater than 300\\xa0W, as shown in Fig.1c and d. The full-width-at-half-maximum (FWHM) of the dominant (002) peak is 0.180\\xa0deg., 0.175\\xa0deg., 0.175\\xa0deg., 0.254\\xa0deg., and 0.254\\xa0deg. For PECWR0\\xa0W, 100\\xa0W, 200\\xa0W, 300\\xa0W, and 380\\xa0W, respectively. This indicates that the tensile stress increases as the power is increased. A higher ECWR power translates to a higher energy and thermal flux at the surface of the substrate (see Supplementary Fig.S1), which results to a greater thermal heating during deposition. Due to the big difference in the thermal expansion coefficients of the soda-lime glass substrate and the ZnO layer (9.17e–6K–versus 4.3e–6K–1), this additional plasma-induced heating of the substrate can ultimately lead to a higher stress for the layers prepared at PECWRof 300\\xa0W and higher. It should be noted that the individual ZnO films have different thicknesses, ranging from 2.1\\xa0μm (100 ECWR) to 3.8\\xa0μm (0 ECWR). The different thicknesses could also have a non-negligible effect on the magnitude of the internal stress in the ZnO films. Figure1e shows that the films deposited with PECWRof 300\\xa0W and 380\\xa0W possess a significantly smaller crystallite size along the (002) direction. A decrease in the crystallite size for increasing PECWRis observed for each of the directions indexed in the XRD spectra, as summarized in Table2. This phenomenon could be related to the higher deposition rate at higher ECWR powers, as shown in Fig.1f. A higher deposition rate leads to the formation of smaller crystallites because atoms accumulate on the surface faster than they have time to reorganize into larger crystals.',\n",

       "  'In Fig.1f, we observe a significant increase in the deposition rate of ZnO films with the applied ECWR power up to 300\\xa0W, while the mid-frequency (MF) power applied to the magnetron discharge PMFremains constant at 300\\xa0W. However, at PECWR= 380, the deposition rate decreases markedly compared to PECWR= 300. The initial increase in the deposition rate can be attributed to the rise in the zinc target’s surface temperature at higher PECWR ,leading to increased evaporation of zinc atoms. This is supported by the high vapor pressure of zinc metal43. However, beyond PECWR= 300\\xa0W, the deposition rate decreases due to a combination of plasma-related effects. As shown in Fig.2, at PECWR= 380\\xa0W, the ion density (ni\\u200b) in the plasma increases significantly, reaching ni≈ 1017m–3. It is well established that in sputtering systems with such high ion densities, a significant fraction of sputtered particles becomes ionized. This phenomenon, observed in systems utilizing magnetron discharges combined with RF ICP plasmas44,45, and in HiPIMS (high-power impulse magnetron sputtering) systems46,47,48,49, leads to the “back attraction” effect. Here, positively ionized sputtered atoms are drawn back toward the negatively biased magnetron target due to electrostatic forces and the electric field within the cathode sheath. This back attraction effect reduces the net flux of sputtered material reaching the substrate, thereby lowering the deposition rate. The substantial ionization of sputtered zinc atoms at high PECWR\\u200b is indirectly supported by Supplementary Fig.S7, which shows strong Zn+ion emission lines with a peak at PECWR= 380\\xa0W. While these observations provide a plausible explanation, a precise quantification of the ionization fraction of sputtered zinc particles is necessary for a definitive understanding. Techniques such as gridded quartz crystal microbalance (QCM)45,50or magnetic QCM51, alongside a detailed physical model, would be valuable for further validation.',\n",

In the films deposited with PECWRof 0\\xa0W and 100\\xa0W, additional peaks are observed at 276\\xa0cm–1, 511\\xa0cm–1, and 581\\xa0cm–1(identified by red fonts in the graph). These peaks are associated with defects in the ZnO crystal and individual bonds52,54. The Raman spectra of the films prepared with PECWRof 200\\xa0W, 300\\xa0W, and 380\\xa0W do not contain any of the peaks associated with defects. The calculated areas of the 276\\xa0cm–1and 511\\xa0cm–1defect-related peaks reveal that the amount of defects decreases as the PECWRincreases, appearing to almost be suppressed when the PECWRis increased to at least 200\\xa0W. To confirm this observation, the photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the films were obtained as shown in Fig.5a. The peak in the UV wavelength region around 380\\xa0nm is the near-band-edge luminescence from ZnO while the broad peak in the visible wavelength region originates from defects, namely zinc interstitials, oxygen interstitials, neutral oxygen vacancy, doubly ionized oxygen vacancy, and excess oxygen involving Zn vacancy complexes42that serve as luminescence centers. The defect-related luminescence is significantly more intense in the films deposited with PECWRof 0\\xa0W and 100\\xa0W compared to films deposited with PECWRof 200\\xa0W, 300\\xa0W, and 380\\xa0W, as shown in Fig.5b. A similar behavior is observed in the cathodoluminescence (CL) spectra of the films shown in Fig.5c and d. These findings are also supported by the transmittance spectra (see Supplementary Fig.S9). ZnO layers deposited by MF\\u2009+\\u2009ECWR (colored curves) exhibit significantly increased transmittance in the visible region above 400\\xa0nm compared to the ZnO layer prepared by MF without ECWR (see black curves in Figs. S9a and S9b). This increased absorption in the visible wavelength region suggests a higher presence of defects, particularly oxygen vacancies or zinc interstitials, which can absorb light with lower energy (longer wavelength) than the standard bandgap absorption. On the other hand, for the ZnO films prepared by MF\\u2009+\\u2009ECWR (colored curves), a relatively sharp absorption edge around 370\\xa0nm (3.3\\xa0eV) is observed. Therefore, the results from the transmission, absorption, PL and CL spectra confirm the observation from the Raman spectra that the number of defects decreases as the PECWRincreases. Figure5a and c also show that the intensity of the 380-nm UV luminescence is highest for the film deposited with PECWRof 100\\xa0W and is lowest for the film deposited with PECWRof 300\\xa0W. The increase in UV emission from 0\\xa0W to 100\\xa0W is associated with a decrease in defect density, as evidenced by the Raman spectroscopy results shown in Fig.4. The presence of defects reduces UV emission due to increase radiative recombination in the visible light range and non-radiative recombination processes. The simultaneous decrease in grain size (as visible in SEM images—Fig.3) lead to a decrease in UV intensity due to an increase in surface recombination, which is non-radiative55. The decrease in the UV intensity in both the PL and CL spectra alludes to the poorer crystallinity of the film deposited with PECWRof 300\\xa0W as it is consistent with the broadening of the dominant (002) diffraction peak at PECWRpower equal to or greater than 300\\xa0W, as discussed in the preceding paragraphs (see Fig.1c). The ratio between the broad visible and the narrow UV emission intensities (Supplementary Fig.S10) decreases as the PECWRincreases from 0\\xa0W to 100\\xa0W and 200\\xa0W owing to the reduction of the number of defects. The film deposited with PECWRof 200\\xa0W, which also had the narrowest (002) diffraction peak and the weakest visible emission intensity, exhibited the smallest ratio. As PECWRis further increased to 300\\xa0W and 380\\xa0W, it can be seen that the ratio also increases, signifying that not only did the films have poorer crystallinity (broader (002) diffraction peak), but also the defect-related visible luminescence has increased. As the ECWR power increases from 0 up to 200\\xa0W, the number of defects in the crystal lattice decreases as observed from the Raman spectra (see Fig.4) and the visible PL and CL spectra (see Fig.5). However, an ECWR power that is very high (300\\xa0W and 380\\xa0W) can lead to the formation of new defects due to a very high ion flux to the substrate (see Supplementary Fig.S2). At the same time, the very high ECWR power leads to a reduction in the size of the crystallites (see Fig.1e). As the crystallite size decreases, the relative amount of surface atoms compared to bulk atoms increases. This effect leads to the formation of more surface defects, which create electronic states within the band gap of ZnO. Therefore, the reduction in crystallite size can result in an increase in defect-related luminescence in the visible region.',\n",

       "  'In order to understand the influence of plasma parameters on the properties of the prepared ZnO layers, the electron temperature and plasma density were measured during the deposition using a modified RF probe56. This measurement was supplemented by optical emission spectroscopy and measurement of the thermal flow to the substrate using a calorimetric probe. The dependence of the electron temperature and plasma density on the ECWR power is shown in Fig.2and supporting data from these measurements are presented in Supplementary Figs.S1toS7. The plasma density increased from 4\\u2009×\\u20091016m–3at PECWRof 0\\xa0W to three times this value at PECWRof 380\\xa0W, confirming that as the ECWR power increases, the plasma density also increases36. At the same time, the effective electron temperature dropped from 9\\xa0eV at PECWRof 0\\xa0W to less than half of that value at PECWRof 380\\xa0W. This significant drop in electron temperature can also be indicated using emission spectroscopy (see Supplementary Fig.S6) Therefore we can conclude that ECWR adds relatively “cold” electrons to the plasma, which, owing to their high concentration, effectively contribute to the dissociation of oxygen molecules (the bond-dissociation energy of the O2molecule is only 5.15\\xa0eV) and also (albeit to a lesser extent) to the excitation and ionization of sputtered Zn particles. Both of these effects are very much visible through the emission spectra (see Supplementary Figs.S4andS5). Excitation and ionization of Zn particles and dissociation of O₂ molecules in plasma have a direct impact on the defect structure of ZnO films. These processes can influence the growth dynamics, mutual reactivity, chemical composition, and quality of the ZnO layer, which can affect the concentration of various types of defects. For example, oxygen dissociation in the plasma can affect the availability of atomic oxygen. If there is a lack of dissociated oxygen in the plasma, oxygen vacancies (VO) may form in the growing ZnO layer. Conversely, if enough atomic or ionized oxygen is present, the number of oxygen vacancies can be reduced. On the other hand, a high concentration of ionized zinc can lead to an excess of zinc atoms in the ZnO structure. These atoms may occupy interstitial positions (Zni) in the crystal lattice, which are also defects that affect the electrical and optical properties of the film. If the zinc ion flux is too high (due to excessive ion flow of zinc), the number of zinc interstitials may increase, leading to undesired defects. The growth of high-quality ZnO layers is therefore very sensitive to the magnitude of the applied ECWR power, as its value strongly influences the aforementioned plasma properties. This consideration also helps in understanding why the “coldness” of the ECWR plasma is very relevant. It supports the (laudable) dissociation of oxygen molecules rather than the (excessive) ionization of zinc (See Supplementary Fig.S7), which could result in unwanted (Zni) defects.',\n",
       "  'A pair of interdigitated aluminum electrodes were deposited on the ZnO films by vacuum evaporation, as shown in Fig.6a.

The dark current (Idark) was measured when the lamp is off. Since the energy corresponding to the VUV wavelength of the light source used (7.75\\xa0eV) is higher than the work function of aluminum (4.1\\xa0eV), electrons can be emitted also from the surface of the aluminum electrode due to the photoelectric effect when the ZnO layer is illuminated. However, since the electrodes on all samples have the same shape, this effect does not influence the comparison between different ZnO layers. The penetration depth of VUV radiation with a wavelength of 160\\xa0nm within the ZnO layer is approximately 50\\xa0nm (see Supplementary Fig.S13).

Remarkably, the photocurrent is 9 orders of magnitude greater than the dark current.',\n",
       "  'The significant decrease in the dark current resulted to a substantial improvement in photosensitivity, whereby the photosensitivity increased by 8 orders of magnitude compared to the film deposited at PECWRof 0\\xa0W. The decrease in dark current is primarily attributed to the reduction in intrinsic defects in the film (namely for ECWR powers 0, 100, and 200\\xa0W), but it is also partially due to the smaller grain size, which gradually decreases with increasing ECWR power and which negatively impacts carriers mobility.',\n",
       "  'As discussed in the preceding paragraphs, the Raman, PL, and CL spectra all confirm that the number of defects decreases as PECWRis increased (for ECWR powers 0, 100 and 200\\xa0W). These defects function as donors or acceptors57. Therefore, less defects translates to a decrease in the carrier density, lowering conductivity when the light is off consequently reducing the dark current. Similarly, the observation that the photocurrent decreases with increasing PECWR(approximately by one order of magnitude for every 100\\xa0W of PECWR) can be explained by the defects. Not only do the defects in the ZnO crystal act as donors and acceptors, but they also contribute to the absorption of the incident radiation, especially of lower-energy photons. Defects can create intermediate states in the band structure between the valence and conduction bands. These intermediate states can absorb light with lower energy (longer wavelengths) than what would normally be required for electron transitions from the valence to the conduction band. As a result, a higher number of defects increases the probability of electron and hole generation even at lower energies. Interestingly, the photosensitivity of the ZnO film deposited with PECWRof 300\\xa0W is lower compared to the photosensitivity of the film deposited with ECWR power of 200\\xa0W even though the dark current is smaller for the 300\\xa0W film. In fact, the film deposited with PECWRof 300\\xa0W exhibits the smallest dark current. The average free path of ZnO is several tens of nm58,59, which is similar to the average crystallite size calculated from the XRD spectra using the Scherrer formula. Therefore, the increase in grain boundaries due to the decrease in crystallite size have a large impact on the carrier lifetime and mobility32,58,59. As the crystallite size decreases, the number of carriers crossing grain boundaries increases, leading to a decrease in mobility. The film deposited with PECWRof 300\\xa0W has the smallest crystallite size (see Fig.1e; Table2) and therefore it exhibits the smallest dark current due to a significant decrease in carrier mobility. In this case, the lower photosensitivity of the film deposited with PECWRof 300\\xa0W is attributed to the decrease in photocurrent. Aside from decreasing carrier mobility in the dark, the increasing number of carriers crossing grain boundaries when illuminated as the crystallite size decreases also leads to an increase in grain boundary scattering and a reduction in carrier lifetime, lowering the photocurrent. As such, the film deposited with PECWRof 300\\xa0W exhibited not only the lowest dark current but also the lowest photocurrent. Note, however, that the low photocurrent has a dominant role in decreasing the overall photosensitivity of this film as it is reduced by two orders of magnitude compared to the film grown at PECWRof 200\\xa0W, while there is no significant change in the dark currents of the two films. Interestingly, even though the average crystallite size along the (002) orientation of the film deposited with PECWRof 300\\xa0W is similar to that of the film deposited at PECWRof 380\\xa0W, the photosensitivity of the film deposited with PECWRof 300\\xa0W is two orders of magnitude lower than that of the film deposited with PECWRof 380\\xa0W. This may be due to the smaller proportion of crystallites oriented along the (002) plane in the film deposited with PECWRof 300\\xa0W (see Fig.1e; Table2). Since the crystallites oriented along the (002) plane exhibit the largest average crystallite size compared to crystallites along the other orientations (see Table2), the decrease in the proportion of these larger crystallites in the film deposited with PECWRof 300\\xa0W results to a smaller overall average crystallite size when including orientations other than (002). Therefore, the carrier lifetime and the photocurrent decreased the most in the 300\\xa0W film, resulting to a smaller photosensitivity for the film deposited with PECWRof 300\\xa0W film compared to the film deposited with PECWRof 380\\xa0W.',\n",
       "  'Overall, we can state that defects decrease significantly from 0\\xa0W to 200\\xa0W and slightly increase from 200\\xa0W to 380\\xa0W. Meanwhile, the grain size gradually decreases with increasing PECWR\\u200b, reaching its smallest value at 300\\xa0W, where the deposition rate is at its maximum. Both of these trends ultimately result in the non-monotonic behavior of the photosensitivity dependence on ECWR power, as observed in Fig.6c.',\n",
       "  'Time-resolved microwave conductivity (TRMC) technique was also utilized to elucidate the charge carrier dynamics in the ZnO films at the hundreds of nanosecond (ns) time scale. Using this method, transient photoconductivity, which is the product of yield (φ) and mobility (µ), is obtained and recombination behavior is monitored. Details of this technique can be found elsewhere60. Briefly, a ns pulsed laser is used to irradiate the sample which generates electron-hole pairs. These photogenerated charges modulate the photoconductivity of the material which is probed using X-band microwaves with frequency between 8 and 12\\xa0GHz. The change in the microwave power ΔP( ω,t)/P (\\\\(\\\\:{(P}_{w/\\\\:light}-{P}_{w/o\\\\:light})/{P}_{w/o\\\\:light}\\\\)) is proportional to the change in conductance (ΔG) from where the kinetics is extracted after rescaling it with the laser fluence (intensity and area,FA), the amount of light absorbed by the material (I0), elementary charge (e), and the ratio between the wide and small inner walls of the microwave guide (β), i.e.,\\\\(\\\\:\\\\phi\\\\:\\\\left({\\\\mu\\\\:}_{e}+{\\\\mu\\\\:}_{h}\\\\right)={\\\\Delta\\\\:}G/{F}_{A}{I}_{0}e\\\\beta\\\\:\\\\)61,62. This is analogous to the photosensitivity measurement discussed above (Eq.\\xa01) but using a high frequency electric field (GHz) rather than a DC bias, and a ns pulsed laser instead of a deuterium lamp for photoexcitation. The laser pulse is then electronically delayed with respect to the GHz probe to provide the time window that displays the relaxation dynamics. To ensure that most, if not all, photoinduced species are mobile charges, a 360\\xa0nm (3.44\\xa0eV) pump is used for excitation, which is 70 meV above the band gap (3.37\\xa0eV). This means that there is at least 10 meV in excess of the exciton binding energy of the sample (60 meV) that would result to direct formation of dissociated electron-hole pairs, i.e., yield is close to unity (φ\\u2009~\\u20091), which allows plotting of ΔG in terms of mobility as shown in Fig.7.',\n",

This 10-fold improvement agrees with the increase in the measured photosensitivity of the device (Table3) as the film becomes more photoconductive. In contrast, at PECWR= 200\\xa0W, the obtained peak ΔG diminished substantially to 0.04 cm2/Vs, a two orders of magnitude reduction.',\n",
       "  'From the Raman, PL, and CL spectroscopy data, the ZnO film grown at this PECWRof 200\\xa0W manifests much lower defects. This was also shown in the device wherein the dark current obtained is 9 orders of magnitude smaller than when PECWRis 0\\xa0W. For the TRMC results, this indicates that right after the laser pulse, photogenerated charge carriers immediately disappear such that before the GHz probe arrives after the first 8 ns (time resolution of the instrument) only few carriers are left. There are two scenarios that can explain this peculiar behaviour. The first scenario is when there are very high density of defects such that photogenerated charges immediately get trapped, substantially lowering the yield before the probe arrives. In the same situation, due to the prevalence of defect sites, mobility of carriers are likewise significantly reduced. The second scenario is when the photogenerated charges cannot find traps (defects) to fill up and instead recombine among themselves. This type of recombination is typically described as second-order, which is characterized by two exponential decays, and is strongly fluence dependent60,63. Plotted in Fig.7b is the normalized ΔG of the films showing the decay of charges up to 900 ns. On the one hand, at PECWR0\\xa0W and 100\\xa0W, a single exponential decay is enough to describe the trace, i.e., τ\\u2009=\\u2009290 and 270 ns, respectively, alluding to its first-order trap-assisted recombination character. On the other hand, at PECWR200\\xa0W, a two-exponential decay (τ1=\\u200936 ns, τ2=\\u20091390 ns) is necessary to appropriately mimic the kinetic trace. Moreover, this decay accelerates as the pump intensity is increased (Supplementary Fig.S12c) demonstrating that it is highly fluence dependent, a key feature of charge recombination that has second-order origin. Also shown in Supplementary Fig.S12(a-e) are fluence-dependent transient Δσ at different PECWR. At PECWR= 200\\xa0W the two-exponential decay is most evident. Although at PECWR0\\xa0W and 300\\xa0W, (Supplementary Figs.S12aand S12d) the decay is somewhat fluence dependent, the effect is less and a single exponential decay is sufficient to depict the traces at some low fluences, details of which will be discussed below. Additionally, note that the lowest excitation fluence required to obtain a relatively decent signal-to-noise (S/N) in the ΔG kinetics for the film grown with PECWRof 200\\xa0W is 0.2\\u2009×\\u20091012ph/cm2. This is 10 times higher than the lowest fluences used for the rest of the samples having similar S/N. This denotes that it is not the limitation of the instrument that ΔG cannot be detected at fluences lower than 0.2\\u2009×\\u20091012ph/cm2, in fact for all other samples, decent S/N is obtained down to 0.02\\u2009×\\u20091012ph/cm2. Rather, this strongly suggests that it is the photophysics of the film itself that required the use of a high excitation fluence to obtain the ΔG. The necessity to pump this film at elevated fluence reinforces our claim that more charge carriers must be generated by the excitation in order to obtain a reasonable ΔG signal as a result of them immediately recombining brought about by the very low defect concentration. Hence, the two orders of reduction in ΔG obtained using TRMC in the ZnO film grown at the PECWRof 200\\xa0W is consistent with the Raman, PL, CL, and photosensitivity data exhibiting the lowest defects, almost mimicking intrinsic semiconductor behavior.',\n",
       "  'For PECWRof 300\\xa0W, the peak ΔG is 0.54 cm2/Vs and the decay at a fluence of 0.2\\u2009×\\u20091012ph/cm2(see Supplementary Fig.S12d) was fitted by a single exponential (τ\\u2009=\\u2009249 ns), implying trap-assisted recombination. This decay rate and mobility are lower than the film grown at PECWRof 100\\xa0W, which is 270 ns and 4.03 cm2/Vs, respectively. This signifies that the population of traps must have increased that shortens the lifetime and hinders the motion of charge carriers. While it is clear from the Raman spectra that the crystallinity increased, i.e., there are less crystalline defects, the GIXRD peaks and SEM images show reduction in the crystallite sizes. In such case, there are more grain boundaries where charge carriers can be trapped resulting to faster recombination rate and lower mobility. This supports the decreased photocurrent measured in the photodetector device. However, it is noteworthy that at fluences higher than 0.2\\u2009×\\u20091012ph/cm2the decays accelerate (see Supplementary Fig.S12d) and require bi-exponential fitting. This indicates that second-order recombination starts to play a role, suggesting that at elevated fluences, traps are already filled such that any excess photogenerated charge carriers begin to find each other and recombine. In other words, while there is an increase in grain boundaries due to small crystallite sizes that trap charge carriers, which lower mobility and shorten the lifetime, this increase is not substantial as they are easily filled at high fluences. This is in accordance with the very low dark current obtained in the device.',\n",
       "  'For PECWRof 380\\xa0W, both the mobility (0.55 cm2/Vs) and lifetime (τ\\u2009=\\u2009251 ns) are very similar to the film grown at PECWRof 300\\xa0W. Despite this, its decay dynamics is fluence independent and was fitted by a single exponential where trap-assisted recombination is the main relaxation mechanism. This means that even at higher fluences, traps are not fully filled suggesting that defect concentration is higher. This is in agreement with the measurement in the device wherein the dark current obtained from the film grown at PECWRof 380\\xa0W is higher than that from the film grown at PECWRof 300\\xa0W.',\n",
       "  'These results demonstrate that ZnO films can be used as photoconductive detectors of VUV radiation, but the photosensitivity is highly dependent on the amount of intrinstic defects and crystallinity of the films. A large number of defects leads to a high dark current, which could make the films almost non-photosensitive as in the case of the film deposited with PECWRof 0\\xa0W (MF only deposition). Increasing PECWRto 200\\xa0W or more decreases significantly the number of defects, causing the films to become photosensitive. In the case of photosensitive films, the size of the crystallites play an important role in their photosensitivity. Small crystallites increase grain boundaries, which lead to a decrease in carrier mobility and low dark current, but at the same time also lead to a decrease in carrier lifetime and low photocurrent. The photosensitivity is ultimately determined by the ratio of the photocurrent to the dark current and the crystallinity of the film. The films deposited at PECWRof 300\\xa0W and 380\\xa0W have poorer crystallinity compared to the film deposited at PECWRof 200\\xa0W, exhibited by the less intense UV emission of the films in their PL and CL spectra (see Fig.5). The poor crystallinity and smaller crystallite size are attributed to the increase in deposition rate and re-sputtering associated with the increase in plasma density at the higher ECWR powers. ZnO films with less defects, large crystallite sizes and good crystallinity, such as that achieved in the film deposited with PECWRof 200\\xa0W, have ideally high photosensitivity. Therefore, the ability to control the amount of defects and crystalline characteristics of the films plays an important role when developing a photosensitive VUV photodetector. The MF\\u2009+\\u2009ECWR deposition technique has the advantage of easily controlling the amount of defects and the crystallinity of ZnO films by adjusting the ECWR power.',\n",
       "  'This study demonstrated the successful deposition of ZnO thin films on soda-lime glass substrates using the MF\\u2009+\\u2009ECWR technique with varying ECWR powers ranging from 0\\xa0W to 380\\xa0W. By controlling the ECWR power, we were able to systematically manipulate the defect concentration and crystallinity of the films, which in turn significantly influenced their photoconductive properties in the VUV region. At an optimal ECWR power of 200\\xa0W, the ZnO films exhibited a remarkable increase in photosensitivity by eight orders of magnitude, primarily due to a drastic reduction in dark current. This reduction was linked to a substantial decrease in intrinsic defects, as confirmed by Raman spectroscopy, photoluminescence (PL), and cathodoluminescence (CL). However, increasing the ECWR power beyond 200\\xa0W led to a reduction in photocurrent, attributed to the formation of smaller crystallites and the corresponding increase in grain boundaries, which shortened the carrier lifetime. Time-Resolved Microwave Conductivity (TRMC) measurements further supported these findings, showing that the films deposited at PECWRof 200\\xa0W had very low trap densities, leading to fast carrier recombination and lower photoconductivity in the ns time scale. This behavior, indicative of second-order recombination, contrasts with the trap-assisted recombination observed in films deposited at lower ECWR powers (0\\xa0W and 100\\xa0W), where higher defect concentrations allowed for longer carrier lifetimes. The TRMC results revealed that at PECWRof 300\\xa0W and 380\\xa0W, while the films exhibited lower dark currents due to the increased grain boundaries, their mobility and photoconductivity were reduced due to faster recombination at grain boundaries. Overall, this study highlights the critical role of ECWR power in optimizing ZnO thin films for VUV photoconductive applications. Films deposited at PECWRof 200\\xa0W offer the best compromise between low dark current and high photocurrent, making them highly suitable for sensitive VUV detection. Further tuning of deposition parameters, informed by techniques such as TRMC, could lead to even more refined control over defect management and charge carrier dynamics.',\n",

They provide better tensile strength, stiffness, wear resistance, yield strength, thermal stability, and low density. These qualities make them ideal for aerospace, automotive, and electronics industries [3,4,5,6].

The use of these long fibers in several MMC applications has been extensively studied. However, one of the key challenges in processing these composites is achieving a balance between properties such as ductility, strength, and toughness. This challenge limits the development and application of MMCs [15]. Fibers with smaller diameters, typically ranging from 5–30\\xa0μm are flexible enough to be handled as bundles or tows. These fibers are known as multifilaments and are made from materials like carbon, silicon carbide (SiC), or oxides. Multifilaments can be filament wound, braided, or woven.

These fibers are less flexible compared to multifilaments, so they are mostly used individually rather than in bundles. The strength of continuous fiber-reinforced MMCs (like stiffness) depends on the direction of the applied load. When a fiber-reinforced composite is subjected to load along the fiber direction under iso-strain conditions, the matrix, fiber, and composite all experience the same amount of strain.

       "  'Directed or controlled solidification is one approach to producing in situ composites [164,165]. During the directed or controlled solidification process, one of the phases solidifies into fibers or rod-like structures (reinforcement) inside the metallic matrix. The spacing between rods/lamellar structures can be regulated by changing the growth speed or cooling rate. For instance, directing the solidification of nickel aluminide (Ni3A1) at a cooling rate of 25\\xa0mm/h resulted in a columnar-grained single-phase structure with approximately 60% tensile ductility (at room temperature). However, increasing the cooling rate to more than 50\\xa0mm/h results in lower ductility for the same material. In binary eutectic alloys, the spacing between rods or lamellae depends on both the cooling rate and the volumetric fraction of the reinforcement in the alloy composition. The distance between rods or lamellae in binary eutectic alloys is determined by the volumetric proportion of reinforcement in the alloy composition as well as the rate of cooling. Furthermore, alloying additions can also control the type of reinforcement. For example, adding Nb or Ta to a TiAl/B melt forms TiB rods, whereas solidifying TiAl/B melt without alloying additions produces TiB2equiaxial particles [166].',\n",

These include the niobium–niobium carbide (Nb–NbC) system, nickel or cobalt (Ni–Co) based eutectic superalloys, iron–titanium carbide composites form the solidification of iron–titanium–carbon (Fe–Ti–C) melts and titanium boride (TiB) rods produced from the solidification of melts containing titanium aluminide (TiAl), tantalum (Ta) and boron (B). However, some disadvantages of the directed or controlled solidification process are the slow growth rates (around 0.4–2.0 in/h). Additionally, thermal gradients cause morphological instabilities, as well as limitations on the volume fraction and types of reinforcement, which have reduced interest in these composites.

This process requires identifying possible reactions and evaluating the driving force based on thermodynamics and kinetics. These factors depend on the composition of alloy, solid, or gas concentrations, diffusion mechanisms across reaction or boundary layers, and temperature [170,171,172,173]. Examples of In-situ composites produced by chemical reactions include aluminum composites (Al2O3/Al) formed from aluminum oxidation and titanium carbide (TiC) reinforced aluminum–copper (Al–Cu) alloys produced by bubbling methane (CH4) and Argon (Ar) gas through the melt.

The residual values of the microhardness response model were uniformly distributed both above and below the zero-point coordinate axis, with no apparent clustering of positive or negative residuals after optimization51. Therefore, this uniform distribution model accurately represents the true microhardness values of nickel–cobalt-phosphorus alloy coatings. To further verify the reliability of the regression analysis model, a comparison of the calculated and actual results is plotted in Fig.2(d). Usually, the closer the scatter distribution lies on either side of the predicted line, the closer the predicted values were to the experimental values, indicating a higher level of model reliability. In this case, all the measured microhardness values were tightly clustered around the predicted line, with no anomalous data points. . This confirmed that the microhardness prediction model effectively explain and illustrate the relationship among the six influencing factors with high accuracy and reliability. This phenomenon was consistent with the conclusion reached by Yan et al.52.

These visual 3D representations effectively presented the optimal factor regions of the experiment. The response surface in the vicinity of a critical point was characterized when the critical point on the graph had been identified. Figure3illustrates the response surface and contour plots for the microhardness model. It can be seen that all six independent variables influence the microhardness of the coatings. The observed nonlinear relationship was indicated by the significant curvature of the response surface, thereby forming a typical quadratic surface. The factors of jet voltage (X1), plating solution temperature (X2), reciprocating sweep speed (X3), jet gap (X4), pulse frequency (X5), and duty cycle (X6) all had poles, indicating that further optimization and analysis of microhardness was feasible. The degree of surface curvature of the response surface directly reflected the strength of interactions between independent variables, with higher curvature indicating stronger interactions.

Figure3(a) shows the response surface for the level of microhardness subject to varying the jet voltage and jet gap. The image reveals a maximum critical point, thereby indicating that the model maximizes the microhardness (Y1). It is evident that increasing jet voltage from level –1 (10\\xa0V) initially caused a sharp increase in the microhardness, which then transitioned to a more gradual increase until it reached an inflection point marking the maximum hardness near level 0 (12\\xa0V). Beyond this point, further voltage increases to level 1 (14\\xa0V) resulted in a decline in the microhardness. Similarly, as the jet gap increased from level -1 (1.5\\xa0mm) to 0 (2.0\\xa0mm), the microhardness of the coatings increased sharply, reaching an inflection point near level 0 (2.0\\xa0mm). Any further increase in the jet gap caused a decline in the microhardness.

This accelerated the grain nucleation rate and improved microhardness of the alloy coating. However, excessive jet injection voltage strengthened the electric field, thereby accelerating consumption of nickel and cobalt ions in the solution. This resulted in insufficient concentration of metal ions near the cathode, reducing the grain refinement effect and ultimately decreasing the microhardness of the coating. It can also be seen that the response surface was steeper in the jet voltage direction, indicating that the impact of jet voltage on microhardness was greater compared to the jet gap.

When the duty cycle increases from level –1 (0.7) towards the critical point, there is a sharp rise in microhardness at first followed by a more gradual rise. Once the inflection point marking the critical point is reached, further increase in duty cycle causes a decrease in microhardness, gradual at first then sharply. The phenomenon can be attributed to increased duty cycle made the conduction time of power supply current also increased, which enhanced the overall electric field strength during the machining process and thus increases its microhardness. Further increased duty cycle, the current conduction of pulse power supply became too long, resulting in insufficient concentration of metal ions near the cathode, weakening the grain refinement effect, and instead reducing the microhardness.

As the plating solution temperature increased from level –1 (55\\xa0°C) to level 0 (60\\xa0°C), there was an increase in microhardness in a relatively uniform manner. At this point, the critical temperature was reached, and further increase in plating solution temperature beyond this level lead to a decrease in microhardness, as evidenced by a shift towards level 1 (65\\xa0°C). The increase in microhardness at lower plating solution temperatures can be attributed to enhanced metallic ion activity, which facilitated faster ion transfer to the cathode, thereby promoting effective deposition, grain nucleation, and grain refinement. This resulted in improved microhardness in the deposited coatings. However, at higher plating solution temperatures, the decrease in microhardness was attributed to a decrease in grain nucleation and an increase in porosity of the deposited coatings. The decrease can be associated with increase in evaporation rates which causes subsequent increase in energy consumption53. Figure3(c1) shows the contour map of the interaction between the two parameters. The contours form nearly circular profiles, suggesting that the interaction between plating solution temperature and jet gap on microhardness was relatively weak.',\n",

The microhardness increased with increase in plating solution temperature until a critical maximum point was reached, beyond which further increase in plating solution temperature lead to a decrease in microhardness. This phenomenon can be attributed to the enhanced diffusion rate of Ni and Co ions in the electrolyte as the plating solution temperature increased from 55\\xa0°C to 60\\xa0°C. This in turn facilitated metal ions transport to internal growth points, which refined the grain structure and improved the microhardness of the coating surface. However, an increase in gas bubble formation in the plating solution may have resulted in increased porosity of the coating, thereby reducing the microhardness.

Within the experimental range, when the pulse frequency was held constant, the microhardness increased significantly with the reciprocating sweep speed then gradually stabilized. This increase can be attributed to a faster diffusion rate of metallic ions through the electrolyte bulk to the substrate surface as the reciprocating sweep speed increased from level –1 (150\\xa0mm·s−1) to the critical point. However, reducing the reciprocating sweep speed and pulse frequency resulted in a significant decrease in microhardness.

Finally, Fig.3(f, f1) show the response surface and contour map illustrating the effect of duty cycle and pulse frequency interactions on the hardness of the deposited Ni–Co–P coatings.

This is the root reason that caused different the thickness. On the other hand, the BN(h) and Al2O3nanoparticles themselves have different properties, it is commonly accepted that BN(h) belongs to the hexagonal system, which is supported by the van der Waals forces between the layers55, But Al2O3particles are hard particles, which can resist plastic deformation and hinder abrasive movement.',\n",
